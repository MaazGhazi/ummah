<b>    BLACK...

    We hear a HIT. A drumstick against a drum head. Crisp, sharp.

    Then a second hit. Then a third and a fourth. The hits
    growing so fast they start to blur together. Like gunfire...


<b>1   INT. NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL STUDIO - GEHRING HALL - NIGHT     1
</b>
    A cavernous space. Sound-proofed walls. And in the center, a
    DRUM SET. Seated at it, in a sweat-marked white T, eyes
    zeroed on his single-stroke roll, is ANDREW NEIMAN.

    He's 19, slight, honors-student-skinny -- except for his
    arms, which have been built from years and years of drumming.

    Suddenly -- a MAN enters the practice room. Stopping, rising--

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Sorry... I'm -- I'm sorry--

<b>                            MAN
</b>               It's ok. Stay there.

    The MAN steps forward, removes his coat. He's tall. Late
    fifties. Black T-shirt, black slacks, black shoes. We'll know
    him as FLETCHER.

    The room is silent now. And then, softly, as he's one of
    those people whose whisper can scare the crap out of you--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               What's your name?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Andrew Neiman, sir.

    (It's pronounced "Nayman".)

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               What year are you?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               I'm a first-year, sir.

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               You know who I am?

<b>                           ANDREW
</b>               Yes...

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               You know what I do?
                       Pink (9/10/2013)                   2


<b>                        ANDREW
</b>          Yes...

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          So you know I'm looking for players.

<b>                        ANDREW
</b>          Yes...

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Then why did you stop playing?

Beat. Andrew nods, smiles. He gets it. Summons up all his
remaining energy and resumes playing, trying to really show
off this time. Rolls, fills, speedy stick-work. He finishes.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Did I say to start playing again?

Andrew looks at him.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I thought--
                 (then, blanching,)
          I'm sorry, I misun--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          I asked you why you stopped playing. Your
          version of an answer was to turn into a
          wind-up drummer monkey.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I'm sorry -- I--I stopped playing becau--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Show me your rudiments.

Andrew nods. Plays one rudiment after another: double-stroke
roll, paradiddle, ratamacue, flam, flamadiddle.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Uh-huh. Double-time swing.

Fletcher begins clapping his hand in time. Fast. Andrew plays.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          No. Double-time. Double it. Bop-bop-bop-
          bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

Andrew tries doubling the tempo. But he can't. Fletcher STOPS
CLAPPING. The sign of death.

Andrew keeps playing, eyes shut... Then -- he hears the door
CLOSE. He stops, and looks up. Fletcher has left the room.
                            Pink (9/10/2013)                     3


    A moment later -- the door OPENS. It's Fletcher. Andrew's
    eyes widen. Maybe it's not over...

<b>                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                 Woopsy-daisy. Forgot my coat.

    Fletcher grabs it, steps back out, CLOSES the door. Andrew
    stares ahead, alone again at the drums -- and totally
    deflated.

    It's over.

    WIDE SHOT of the band room as Andrew slowly rises. A title card:

<b>2   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - SHAFFER CONSERVATORY - NIGHT          2
</b>
    Andrew exits, hurries off. Pasted onto his overloaded back-
    pack are patches, buttons, names: Krupa. Roach. Buddy Rich...

    The buildings of midtown New York loom over him like giants --
    immense, forbidding...


<b>3   INT. MOVIE THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT                           3
</b>
    A quiet two-screen theater. Andrew buys concessions. The GIRL
    at the counter is about his age. She's pretty, but doesn't
    really know it. More to the point, she doesn't seem to care.
    Her name is NICOLE.

<b>                              NICOLE
</b>                 Swedish fish?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                 Nah, not this time, thanks...

    Andrew and Nicole exchange smiles. He takes his items --
    popcorn, Raisinets, two sodas -- and heads off. Peers back at
    Nicole. She's staring into space. She looks suddenly lonely.

    Andrew takes in the sight. You can tell he's attracted to her
    -- but he's too nervous to do anything. A beat later, he
    enters the theater.


<b>4   INT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER                           4
</b>
    Andrew spots a 53-year-old man seated near the front. This is
    his dad -- JIM. Mild-mannered, soft-spoken, average in every
    respect. Has the eyes of a former dreamer.
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                        4


A smile between the two of them. Andrew hands his dad the
Raisinets, hands him the drink. Routine. The movie hasn't
started yet. As they exchange items--

<b>                       JIM
</b>          You ok?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Sure...

A beat.

<b>                       ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          He had me play today.

<b>                       JIM
</b>          And?

Andrew shrugs. It's clear what that means.

<b>                       JIM (CONT'D)
</b>          You still have other options.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>                       JIM
</b>          It's good to be open-minded. When I was
          your age I thought I'd have a book deal
          at 23. Then that changed to 30. Then 40.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Right... And that didn't upset you?

Jim shrugs, keeps his eyes down. He has a tendency to look
down when talking. The lights dim. The previews begin.

<b>                       ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          I mean, it has to do something to you.

<b>                       JIM
</b>                 (another shrug)
          I don't know. Why? It's just life.
                 (pause)
          There's other things to care about.
          Friends. Romance...

Andrew takes it in. Especially the last part.

<b>                       JIM (CONT'D)
</b>          At my age you get perspective.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I don't want perspective.
                            Pink (9/10/2013)                    4A


    Jim smiles. A moment.

    Just then a MOVIEGOER squeezes into the row to head to a
    seat further down -- and bumps against Jim and his bucket
    of popcorn.

<b>                             JIM NEYMAN
</b>              Sorry.

    The Moviegoer doesn't say a word. Andrew watches. Takes
    it in.

    Rusty elevator doors squeak open. Andrew steps out -- into a
    grimy, green-walled hallway.
                         Pink (9/10/2013)                     6


    Dim lights, loud MUSIC blaring from behind a door. A thudding
    party beat...

    At the end of the hall -- where the music is coming from -- a
    few PARTYGOERS mingle by a door. The door opens. A YOUNG MAN
    hands a SECOND YOUNG MAN a wad of cash in exchange for a Zip-
    lock bag of PILLS. The SECOND YOUNG MAN eyes Andrew.

    Andrew turns away, heads left -- to his own door. Hurriedly
    opens it and slips inside.


<b>7   INT. DORMITORY - ANDREW'S ROOM - NIGHT                    7
</b>
    A single. Drumsticks and drum pads scattered, biographies of
    Bach and Coltrane on the shelf, posters of Louis Armstrong
    and Charlie Parker on the walls. A TV is on, some sort of
    music documentary. Andrew watches from his bed -- as, over
    OLD AUDIO OF DRUMMING and old stills of a boy at a drum set --

<b>                           NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>              By the age of ten, Traps the Boy Wonder
              was wowing crowds all over America. By
              his teens, Buddy Rich was well on his way
              to becoming the stuff of legend.

<b>                           TALKING HEAD #1
</b>              Like any truly great player, Buddy seemed
              to have been born with music in his
              blood. He grasped it intuitively, in a
              way you and I just can't.

<b>                           TALKING HEAD #2
</b>              You check out the old stuff, man. You look
              at those movies when he was a kid, his
              arms...

    Beat. Andrew takes it all in -- especially these words:

<b>                           TALKING HEAD #2 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>              You just can't teach that. That kind of
              genius.
                     (pause)
              You either got it or you don't.

    Andrew turns off the TV. We hear the party beat continuing
    outside, muffled. He leans back and switches off his light.

<b>                                                      WE FADE OUT.

<b>8   INT. GEHRING HALL - NASSAU BAND ROOM - DAY                  8
</b>
    The same room we saw Andrew practicing in at night -- only now
    it's full of musicians. Mostly male, mostly first- and second-
    years. This is NASSAU BAND, one of Shaffer's lower-level jazz
    ensembles. Because it's Shaffer, the players are still first-
    rate. A few third-years are here, too -- including a red-head
    drummer with the body of a linebacker. RYAN CONNOLLY.

    Andrew looks up -- in time to see Ryan with a GIRL by the
    doorway. Ryan's girlfriend is gorgeous -- tall, all curves.
    Ryan lets his hand slide down her shoulder. Andrew watches...

    The GIRL waves bye to Ryan as he heads in. He's all macho
    confidence.

<b>                           TRUMPETER
</b>              My man Ry! Shit, how you feeling?

<b>                           RYAN
</b>              Stitched up at last, dude.

<b>                           TRUMPETER
</b>              Things were hurting with Neiman on the kit--

    Ryan taps him to stop. Andrew is within earshot -- and has
    heard. Beat. Ryan moves over to Andrew, sits down at the set.

<b>                           RYAN
</b>              You have a good weekend, bro?

<b>                           ANDREW
</b>              Yeah. Definitely. Really good.

<b>                           RYAN
</b>              Don't worry about Greg. He's a dick.

    Andrew nods. Admires Ryan. Seems more diminutive now than ever.

<b>                           RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>              You been practicing?

<b>                           ANDREW
</b>              Yeah. All the time.

<b>                           RYAN
</b>              My man.

    Then -- the Nassau Band conductor appears: RON KRAMER.

<b>                           MR. KRAMER
</b>              Morning, fellas. "Billie's In", bar 8.

    Mr. Kramer CLAPS OFF in time -- and the band begins playing
    FIRST NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL CHART. Mid-tempo. Ryan's
    confident, in control. Andrew turns his pages, watches...

<b>                           MR. KRAMER (CONT'D)
</b>              Nice, Ryan... Woah, trumpets.

</b>              Yeah, yeah - sorry about that one.                    **

</b>              Just brass again.                                     **

    To Ryan's left, a whisper--                                     **

<b>                            TRUMPETER
</b>              Ry...

    Ryan turns. Visible as a silhouette through the frosted glass
    of the main door...is FLETCHER. Andrew turns and looks as
    well. Tenses up.

    Fletcher lingers outside. Then he walks on. Ryan turns back to
    the Trumpeter.

<b>                            RYAN
</b>              Not today.

    except for Andrew, who's hanging back...

<b>                           ANDREW
</b>              Yeah... He's been great to me.

<b>                           MR. KRAMER

<b>                       MR. KRAMER
</b>          Andrew -- you've got a good attitude. You
          always arrive on time.

Andrew nods. Waiting.
                      Pink (9/10/2013)                       9


<b>                       MR. KRAMER (CONT'D)
</b>          Yeah. Ok?

<b>                        ANDREW
</b>                 (beat)
          Ok... Do you think... I know Fletcher's
          looking for players...for Studio Band...

<b>                       MR. KRAMER
</b>          Yeah, Andrew... Lincoln Center looks out
          for Fletcher's top players. If it weren't
          for Ryan's injury he'd have been in Studio
          Band last year. He's a natural player.

Andrew takes this in. Nods.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Ok.

<b>                       MR. KRAMER
</b>                 (this is awkward)
          Look... I'm going to be candid. 90% of
          our players will never make it into the
          Lincoln Centers or the Collectives. The
          question is -- who's in that 10%?

A beat.

<b>                       MR. KRAMER (CONT'D)
</b>          So I'd practice. You could start a rock
          band.

Andrew takes it in. The implication is clear.

He turns -- and glimpses a poster on the wall: a DRUMMER
throwing a stick in the air mid-solo. Buff. Confident. The
opposite of him.

<b>                       ANDREW

<b>11A   INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS        11A
</b>
      Through the pane of glass, Andrew can see a FULL ORCHESTRA.
      Everyone looks older than in Nassau. More focused. All eyes
      glued on Fletcher as he assumes his position...

      Fletcher's right arm moves, just a hair, and the band starts:
      fast, dazzling. Andrew watches -- in awe. The band's playing
      STUDIO BAND EAVESDROP CHART, and the sound is so full, so
      precise, so commanding. Nothing like Nassau.

      And suddenly -- Fletcher TURNS AROUND. His eyes meet Andrew's.
      Andrew ducks out of view -- shit --

      -- and hurries away.


<b>12    INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER          12
</b>
      Andrew practices like mad, trying to nail a double-time swing.
      To his left a digital METRONOME blinks. The time set: 380.
      Andrew stops. Resets the metronome. 390. Resumes playing.
      Tries to keep up. Resets the metronome to 400. Can't keep up
      at all now. Struggling, sweating, hands blistering, when --

      CRAAACK. Andrew's right drumstick SNAPS IN HALF.

      He stops. Spent. Looks at his hand, sweating and throbbing from
      the blisters.

      Looks back at the metronome. Still beeping away. He turns it off.

      Glances up ahead at a poster -- of BUDDY RICH hunched over a drum

Stares at the image. Then looks down -- at the PAPERWORK we
saw earlier. The heading: "APPLICATION TO TRANSFER"...

<b>12A   INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER               12A
</b>
      A CD slides into a player. The title: "BUDDY RICH: BIRDLAND".
      Andrew skips ahead to the third track. Immediately, drums
      start. Another double-time swing. Only this one is insanely
      fast. Even faster than Andrew was going.

      Andrew listens. Looks at his drum kit. Thinks. Makes a decision.
      Turns the CD off.


<b>13    INT. MOVIE THEATER - LOBBY - AFTERNOON                    13
</b>
      The same movie theater as before. Andrew marches in. Has one
      goal and one goal only now.

      Walks up to Nicole at the counter. Takes a deep breath, and--

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                Hey -- look -- I -- I don't know how to
                say this -- I see you in here all the
                time and -- I was just wondering --
                       (stops, collects himself,)
                -- if you'd want to get a bite to eat
                with me.

      Beat. Nicole just looks at him. Andrew can't believe he said what
      he just said. Feels like a creep. Instantly regrets it.

<b>                             NICOLE
</b>                Please get away from me.

<b>                             ANDREW

</b>                I'm kidding.

      She smiles. Beat. Andrew manages a nervous laugh.

<b>                             NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>                That your dad you always come in with?

</b>                       (discombobulated, trying to keep up--)
                Kind of bobs up and down when he walks?
                That's him.

<b>                             NICOLE
</b>                       (laughs; then,)
                Andrew, right? I'm Nicole.

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                Nice to meet you, Nicole...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Monday. Ok. Great. I'll be here Monday.

     A moment -- an awkward silence -- then Andrew turns -- and,
     in a daze, realizing what's just happened, his spirits
     suddenly starting to soar -- he glides off.


<b>14   INT. GEHRING HALL - LOBBY OUTSIDE DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY       14
</b>
     The next morning. Andrew, still riding high, is seated in a
     lobby outside the DEAN's OFFICE. In his hand -- a FILLED-OUT
<b>     TRANSFER APPLICATION.
</b>
<b>                            ASSISTANT

               Dr. Fletcher would like to see you.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Oh. Ok...

     Andrew's thoughts are elsewhere. Distracted -- not sure what
     this is about but doesn't really care -- he dutifully follows...


<b>15   INT. GEHRING HALL - FLETCHER'S OFFICE - DAY                 15
</b>
     BLACK. We hear knocking.

<b>                            FLETCHER (O.S.)
</b>               Come in.

     A door opens -- the black gives way -- and we see, seated at
     a polished mahogany desk, Fletcher. He looks as imposing --
     and as well-dressed -- as ever.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Hey, Andrew! I guess Sophie found you?

     Andrew is taken aback. Fletcher remembers his first name?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yes... I'm... I--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Come in, come in, close the door...

     Fletcher rises to greet Andrew, as Andrew closes the door.
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                       13


<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I like to chat with students coming in
          and going out. I hear you're going out?

Andrew looks surprised by the warmth in Fletcher's voice.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Yes. Transferring. To Columbia.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Terrific. Columbia's a terrific school.
          Did something precipitate this?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I just decided to...
                 (not sure how to say it)
          ...to try out some other things. Not focus
          only on drums. You know?

Beat. Fletcher looks at him. Is he upset? Dismayed?

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Bravo.
                 (as he starts to head back
                  toward his desk--)
          Too many students clamp down on their
          "pursuits" like leeches.
                 (sits atop his desk)
          Hobbies they picked up in their teens,
          and for what? Take a seat.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (starts heading to a couch)
          Uh... Yeah.. I mean, I --
                 (passes by a "1st Place Prize"
                  plaque on a coffee-table)
          -- I was a little younger than my teens
          when I started drums, but--

<b>                       FLETCHER

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Six.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Oh. Well, kids start swimming when they're
          six, doesn't mean they're Michael Phelps.
          It's a hobby, never anything you consider
          going all the way with. Am I right?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Definitely. I mean -- well -- for a time,
          I thought I'd go all the way -- but, yeah--
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                       14


<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Well, kids want anything. I wanted to be
          a nanny. Thank God those I trusted talked
          me out of it. Good to listen to advice.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Yes, I've done that, you're right, it's--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          --good to get outside perspectives. So
          long as they don't have ulterior motives,
          I'd listen to what the people you trust
          tell you.

Andrew nods. But that phrase seems to echo. Ulterior motives...

Fletcher hops down from the desk and makes his way to the
couch.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          So what's the passion you've chosen to
          pursue at Columbia, then?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (as Fletcher takes a seat next to
                  him)
          Oh... Well... I'm not...not really sure.
          It's not a specific thing I have in mind.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Ah. Well that's ok. You're young. Most
          people, it takes years for them to find
          their calling. My father, for instance --
          he had no idea what he wanted at your age.
          He tried a lot of things, a little bit of
          this, a little bit of that. Took him years
          before he realized his dream was
          insurance. That was his passion. The
          cubicle, the coffee breaks, the dry wall.

He lets this simmer for a beat. Then--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm sure you'll find your calling as well.

He rises back up. A moment of silence.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I guess that's it, then. Any questions?

He notices Andrew looking at a photo on the wall.
                       Pink (9/10/2013)                    15


<b>                         FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>            That's Sean Casey. Graduated three years
            ago. Now he's first trumpet at Lincoln
            Center.
                   (heading toward the door--)
            He came a long way.

<b>                         ANDREW
</b>                   (trying to collect his thoughts
                    as he rises)
            ...So -- are you -- still looking for
            Studio Band players then...?

<b>                         FLETCHER
</b>                   (turning around to face Andrew)
            Some, yes. But it's no cakewalk. Most kids
            here can't last. Laszlo Polgar, Hungarian
            psychologist, declares in 1967 that talent
            is all about conditioning. Says he can make
            his kids, whoever they are, the best in the
            world at something. What that something is
            he'll decide. He's a lousy chess player but
            he picks chess because it's objective. Goes
            around looking for a wife, finds one who
            agrees to his experiment. Starts having
            kids: Susan, Sofia and Judit. Gets them
            practicing before they can even talk. These
            weren't kids who were sitting and smelling
            the roses. These were kids who were going
            to leave an actual mark on the world. Who
            was the top female player by 1984? Susan.
            Who played the eight-straight-wins "Miracle
            of Rome" in 1989? Sofia. And who is
            universally considered the greatest female
            chess player of all time? Judit.

He takes   a breath. Smiles. We linger for a second on Andrew,
standing   in place, taking it all in. Andrew's eyes quickly
drift to   the photos behind Fletcher -- the images on the
walls...   The Studio Band with Wynton Marsalis. Fletcher at the
JVC Jazz   Festival. One jazz luminary after another...

<b>                         FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>            Which is why I'm sure you'll be great at
            whatever you set your mind to at Columbia.
                   (puts his arm around Andrew, starts
                    escorting him toward the door--)
            It was a pleasure chatting, Andrew, now--

<b>                         ANDREW
</b>            I just -- one thing first -- I mean -- I'm
            not entirely sure I'm transferring yet...
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                     16


<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Well that's worrisome. I'm sure you had
               good reason to make your decision.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               I -- just might give it some more time--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               No need to do that. First instincts are best.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               My first instinct...is not to transfer...

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               I'm not sure your first instinct is
               right, then. Why don't you give it some
               more thought, and in the meantime...
                      (reaches the door; about to close--)
               ...make sure your double-time swing is
               ready by Monday's Nassau Band.

     He closes the door. WE LINGER on Andrew. A spark has been lit.


<b>16   INT. GEHRING HALL - NASSAU BAND ROOM - NIGHT              16

     Andrew plays the drums with Nassau Band. Keeps missing hits.
     The song's SECOND NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL CHART (ANDREW).

<b>                            MR. KRAMER
</b>               Alright, that's... That's enough of that.
               Back to just the core, please.

     MUSICIANS trade places. As Ryan trades with Andrew, he turns--

<b>                            RYAN
</b>               Dude -- what've you been practicing?

     Just then, the DOOR SWINGS OPEN -- and in steps FLETCHER. All
     eyes go to him. All talking ceases. Absolute silence, save for
     Fletcher's footsteps. Andrew waits. Heart pounding...

     Fletcher arrives at the head of the band -- as Kramer silently
     and meekly retreats. Fletcher props up the music stand to his
     height, looks down at the sheet music, runs his finger down it
     to find the spot he wants... Andrew, like all the other
     players, is dead-still, eyes glued on Fletcher's every move...

     Fletcher looks up, surveys the band with his eyes. Then, raising
     his hand--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Down the line.

to miss a beat.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Trumpets. Bars 36 to 38. One-two--

The TRUMPETER on the right starts playing. Five notes before
Fletcher cuts him off with the slightest flick of his hand.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Next. One-two--
                 (the SECOND TRUMPETER misses
                  his cue)
          Next. One-two--

Nothing. Fletcher looks up. There are no more trumpeters. He
looks over at Kramer: "Are you serious?"

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Trombone. Bars 21 to 23. Four-and--

                  find the right page)
          Saxes. 48 to 50. "And" of one. And-one--
                 (ALTO SAX gets through one bar)
          Next--

Before he even counts off, he notices the TENOR SAX's
fingering -- all he needs to know.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Drums.

We get a split-second glimpse of the TENOR SAXOPHONIST,
wondering what just happened -- before we CUT to the drums,
Ryan at the ready.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Double-time swing.

Ryan takes a breath. Fletcher CLAPS him off. Ryan plays.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Thank you. You. Behind.

Palms sweaty, Andrew takes Ryan's place. Trains his eyes on
Fletcher's hands. Deep breath. Fletcher CLAPS, and Andrew begins
-- trying to get the motion right, trying to stay in time--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Thank you. Bass. Five bars of "Donna

We STAY ON Andrew as the BASSIST plays; Andrew slides off the
drums and back to his regular seat.

               Thank you.

     We CUT back to Fletcher. He looks over the band once more. We
     see the MUSICIANS' faces -- scared, but hopeful. Then--

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Drums. Come with me.

     Ryan's heart starts speeding. His excitement visible, he--

<b>                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Other drums.

     Ryan freezes. Andrew is stuck in place for a moment. Then,
     eyes wide -- is this really happening? -- he rises and
     approaches the doorway... There, Fletcher hands him an ORANGE
<b>     PAPER SLIP.
</b>
<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Give this to Admin for rescheduling. We
               meet 6am to 1pm every day. Room B16.

     And with that, he EXITS.

     In a daze, Andrew drifts back toward the band. Kramer looks at
     him. Andrew answers the look with a defiant smile. Vindicated.

<b>                            MR. KRAMER
</b>               Ok fellas, let's...let's take it back from
               the top..

     He claps off. The band plays SECOND NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL CHART
     (RYAN). Andrew pretends not to notice Ryan's eyeing him in
     shock. Just sits down, lets it all settle.

     And -- ever so slowly -- Andrew's face dissolves into a GRIN...


<b>17   INT. PIZZERIA - NIGHT                                    17

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               This is a nice place.

     We're at a cheap pizzeria now. Nicole is seated, two half-
     eaten slices of pepperoni in front of her. An old jazz track
     is playing -- PIZZERIA CHART.

     Seated across from Nicole is Andrew -- echoes of the earlier
     grin still on his face, a brightness in his eyes.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah, I come here a lot.
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                    19


Beat. Then -- clicking back to reality -- this is not a nice
place, did I fuck up? --

<b>                       ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          They have good music, so I -- it's not
          just the food...
                 (points, re: the tune)
          This is Jackie Hill, "When I Wake", July
          17th, 1938, Bob Ellis on drums.

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          Are you trying to impress me?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          No -- sorry -- I didn't mean -- they have
          like -- ten songs they loop through.
          They're always playing the same thing.

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          And you know the dates to all ten?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          ...Yeah.

Nicole smiles. A moment. Andrew fidgets. Nervous.

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          You know every time I saw you in the
          theater you always had your eyes pointed
          to the floor.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Really?

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          Like you were fascinated by the soda
          stains on the carpet.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          My dad tells me I have a problem making
          eye contact.

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          My parents like to criticize me   too. When
          I was growing up my mom told me   my chin
          was too big and that that's why   guys
          wouldn't like me. `Cause my dad   had
          cursed me with a big chin.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          What?
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                    20


<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          Yeah, it's -- look --
                 (she turns, points her chin up)
          It's Jay Leno.

Andrew laughs. Nicole looks prettier to him than ever.

<b>                       NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>          She keeps asking me if I have a boyfriend
          yet, and then blames it on the chin.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          She sounds insane.

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          She wanted to be an actress when she was
          my age.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          And you? What do you do?

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          Other than serving you popcorn?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          What do you want to do with your life?

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>                 (thinks; wasn't prepared for
                  a question that direct)
          I go to Fordham... I'm not sure...

<b>                       ANDREW

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          I don't have one yet.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Well what did you come here to study?

<b>                       NICOLE
</b>          I just came here for a general education.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Right, but you picked Fordham for a
          reason. Why Fordham?
                       Pink (9/10/2013)                   21


<b>                         NICOLE
</b>            I applied to a bunch of schools, Fordham
            let me in. Why'd you pick Shaffer?

<b>                         ANDREW
</b>            It's the best music school in the country.

Beat. Nicole shrugs.

<b>                         NICOLE
</b>            Well Fordham was Fordham.

A moment.

<b>                         NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>            I don't love it there to be honest...

<b>                         ANDREW
</b>            No?

<b>                         NICOLE
</b>            I mean -- the people there... I don't
            think they like me. I'm from Arizona and --
            I don't know, I think they see it in me.

A beat. Andrew thinks about this, then--

<b>                         ANDREW
</b>            I don't like the people at Shaffer
            either. But I think it just takes time...
            Things change, you know.

<b>                         NICOLE
</b>            I know.
                   (then, opening up more than
                    she expected, more fragility
                    in her voice now)
            I feel homesick sometimes. You know? I
            hate how people in college pretend they
            never feel homesick. Or maybe I'm
            literally the only one, but... I don't
            think so.

A moment of silence. She looks at Andrew. He looks at her.

<b>                         ANDREW
</b>            I know exactly how you feel.
                   (then, he smiles)
            I still go to the movies with my dad.

Nicole nods. Smiles back. Andrew said it playfully, but she
can tell he also meant it to reach out to her.
                           Pink (9/10/2013)                    22


      She scoots her legs. Her knee happens to touch Andrew's. He
      notices. So does she. They look at each other.

<b>                             NICOLE
</b>                ...I like this song.

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                Yeah -- this part is great -- here --

      Nicole smiles. Looks at Andrew. He looks back. Their knees
      stay still, just barely touching.

      And, on this moment, just as the song ends --


<b>18    INT. DORMITORY - ANDREW'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN                18
</b>
      Andrew's in bed -- fast asleep. Seems stress-free for once --
      his body totally relaxed, his mind deep in a dream. His arm
      hits his night stand -- WAKING him up. His eyes open. He looks
      at his alarm clock. It reads: 5:17.

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                Shi--


<b>18A   INT. DORMITORY - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                 18A

      Andrew bursts out of his room and RACES down the hall.


<b>19    EXT. DORMITORY - NEW YORK STREET - MOMENTS LATER         19
</b>
      Andrew DASHES across the green. It's still pitch black outside,
      the city cold and menacing.


<b>20    INT. GEHRING HALL - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS               20
</b>
      Andrew busts inside, runs down the STAIRWELL -- and SLIPS.
      Falls full-throttle down a whole flight, hands smacking
      against the tile. Rises, sore, and keeps running.


<b>20A   INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS        20A
</b>
      Andrew reaches ROOM B16 -- pushes open the doors--
                           Pink (9/10/2013)                    23


<b>20B   INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS       20B
</b>
      --only to find the room EMPTY. No one is there. Andrew checks
      the time on his phone: 5:33. Did he miss them...?


<b>20C   INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS       20C
</b>
      Andrew steps back into the hallway. Spots a SIGN-UP SHEET at
      the door. Looks at it. Sees the words "STUDIO BAND" scrolled
      down for each day. The listed start-time: "9AM".


<b>21    INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - MORNING           21
</b>
      Andrew sits on the drum throne. A clock on the wall reads:
      8:57. He's dozed off, is out cold. His hand, cut from his fall
      down the stairs, rests against the snare drum.

      Suddenly -- the DOOR opens --

<b>                             SAXOPHONIST #2
</b>                She told me to pull out, then wet the
                whole fucking bed.

<b>                             SAXOPHONIST
</b>                No, serious??

      Andrew shoots up. Surges to his feet. The SAXOPHONISTS don't pay
      him any attention. They're big guys, macho. Another DOOR opens.
<b>      MORE PLAYERS...
</b>
      These are the CORE MEMBERS of Studio Band -- Shaffer's cream
      of the crop. Mostly third- and fourth-years. All male. A few
      ALTERNATES follow, first- and second-years.

      Andrew watches as the PLAYERS buzz their mouthpieces, whip
      open their folders, pull out their instruments. A flurry of
      chatter and activity...

      One of the CORE MEMBERS heads to the drums: CARL TANNER, 22.
      Andrew sees him, and--

<b>                             CARL
</b>                You the new alternate?

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                Yeah -- I'm -- Andrew Neiman...

<b>                             CARL
</b>                       (couldn't care less about his name)
                Tune the set to a B-flat. Then you'll
                turn my pages during rehearsal.
                        Pink (9/10/2013)                  24


Andrew, nervous, sits back down at the drums and--

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (to the PIANIST)
          Excuse me?
                 (no answer)
          Um -- sorry -- excuse me?
                 (the Pianist looks at him)
          Could I have a B-flat please?

The Pianist plays a B-flat. Andrew tunes. By now the room is
filled: TRUMPETS, TROMBONES, SAXES.

<b>                       ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>                 (to the Pianist)
          Excuse me -- could I maybe have ano--

But Carl has already risen. Ushers Andrew back up. Sits down at
the drums, as Andrew sits down by the music stand.

<b>                       SAXOPHONIST #2
</b>          Milk the cunt!!

The PIANIST plays a middle C, and the players start tuning to
it.

Andrew watches, listens -- the sea of sounds building, the clock
on the wall ticking, until -- it hits 9:00.

THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. Fletcher marches in, carrying a stack
of sheet music. Sudden tension -- and utter silence.

Fletcher sets his music down. Stares at the band. Dead-serious,
silently judging. A moment passes...

Then -- he SMILES. He's switched all of a sudden to warm and
cuddly.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          We've got a squeaker today, people.
          Neiman.
                 (he pronounces it "Neeman")
          Nineteen years old. Isn't he cute?

Laughs throughout the room. We can overhear a few snickers:

<b>                         PLAYERS (O.S.)
</b>          Neee-man...

Andrew looks. Fletcher keeps his smile up... And then--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Alright, gang. "Whiplash".
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                    25


The players get out the chart. Andrew catches a glimpse --
a messy clutter of notes and time signatures...

Fletcher raises his hand. Total silence. Then -- the
slightest move of Fletcher's finger, and the band begins
WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL CARL #1. The chart's named
"Whiplash" for a reason. It's fast, frenetic, 7/4 time. This
fast, with this many polyrhythms, it's impossibly hard.

<b>                       CARL
</b>          Page... Page...

Andrew turns the page. Carl glares. Shouldn't have had to tell
him to turn it. But Andrew can't follow. The band's too fast..

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Stop. You. Barker.
                 (pointing to the THIRD
                  TRUMPETER'S horn)
          That is not your boyfriend's dick. Do not
          come early. Moving ahead. Bar 93.

The players flip their sheet music. Andrew catches a glimpse
of a TROMBONIST ejecting the spit from his horn. A puddle has
formed by his feet.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Five-six-seven--

The band plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL CARL #2.
Intense, visceral. Fletcher paces back and forth, eyeing
players as they play. He's got fox's ears, hawk's eyes. Every
sinew of his body is focused. Andrew watches, awed, scared,
completely overwhelmed.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Stop!

The band comes to a halt.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Now this one upsets me. We have an out-of-
          tune player. Before I go any further, does
          that player want to do the right thing and
          reveal himself?
                 (silence)
          Ok. Maybe a bug flew in my ear. Bar 115.
          Five-six-and--

He cues the BAND with his hand, then cuts them off.
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                    26


<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          No, I guess my ears are clean because we
          most definitely have an out-of-tune
          player. Whoever it is, this is your last
          chance.
                 (paces back and forth, slowly)
          Either you know you are out of tune, and
          are therefore deliberately sabotaging my
          band; or you do not know you're out of
          tune -- which I'm afraid is even worse.

Nothing. The players avert his gaze. All terrified...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Reeds. Five-six-and--
                 (they play, he cuts them off)
          Bones. Five-six-and--
                 (they play, he cuts them off)
          Ahhhh, he's here.

Silence. He eyes the TROMBONISTS. Lands on one, METZ. Overweight.
Been picked on his whole life.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Tell me it's not you, Elmer Fudd.

Metz sits there, trembling. On the brink of tears.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          It's ok. Play.
                 (Metz does so, Fletcher stops
                  him, leans in, whispers--)
          Do you think you're out of tune?

Metz, terrified, looks down at the floor.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          There's no fucking Mars Bar down there.
          Look at me. Do you think you're out of
          tune?

<b>                         METZ
</b>          ...Y--yes...

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Then why the FUCK didn't you say so?!?

Silence. It's the first time we've heard Fletcher really SHOUT.
His voice is booming, louder than one would have thought. Then--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I've been carrying your fat ass for too
          long, Metz.
<b>                       (MORE)

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               I will not let you cost us a competition
               because your mind's on a fucking Happy
               Meal and not on pitch. Stein,
               congratulations, you are now fourth-chair
               trombone. Metz -- get the fuck out.

     Still trembling, tears bubbling out, Metz picks up his
     trombone and walks to the door. Andrew watches -- shocked.

     Once the door closes--

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               For the record, Metz was not out of tune.
               You were, Wallach. But Metz didn't know
               it. And that's bad enough.

     And then -- he looks straight at Andrew.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Alright, take ten. When we get back --
               the squeaker's on.

     Andrew's face goes ghost-white.


<b>22   INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER     22

     Andrew sits in the corner of the hall, the "WHIPLASH" sheet
     music in his hand. Tries desperately to count the beats...

<b>                            ANDREW

     He scribbles on the page, trying to compute the patterns: "7/9
     + 7/4 = 7/18". "1/64 X 7/9"... We see feet pass by, and hear--

     Andrew's eyes follow the PLAYERS. They're tall, built. Next
     to them Andrew feels like a scrawny teen.

Just then -- a PAIR OF DRESS SHOES reach Andrew's side.
Startled, Andrew looks up. It's Fletcher. Andrew scrambles to
his feet, as Fletcher puts his arm over him and -- earnestly,
back to the warm tone he displayed days ago --

<b>                       FLETCHER

          Listen, Andrew. I know what you saw in
          there is worrying you, but there's a big
          difference. This is your first day.

        at Andrew--)
Besides, you're no Elmer Fudd. This is a
huge opportunity for you. You know that,
right?

<b>             ANDREW
</b>Yeah...

<b>             FLETCHER
</b>Your parents musicians?

<b>             ANDREW
</b>No, not really...

<b>             FLETCHER
</b>What do they do?

<b>             ANDREW
</b>Well, my dad's a writer.

<b>             FLETCHER
</b>What's he written?

<b>             ANDREW
</b>Well he's...I guess he's mainly a
teacher.

<b>             FLETCHER
</b>College?

<b>             ANDREW
</b>Pennington High.

<b>             FLETCHER
</b>And your mom?

<b>             ANDREW
</b>I don't know... She left when I was a
baby.

<b>             FLETCHER
</b>So no musicians in the family.

<b>             ANDREW
</b>...No, I guess not...

<b>             FLETCHER
</b>Well, you've just got to listen to the

know, Charlie Parker became "Bird"

</b>               The key is -- relax. Don't worry about

               think. You're here for a reason. You
               believe that, don't you?

     A beat. And, finally--

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Now have fun.

     He pats Andrew on the back -- then promptly walks off.

</b>
     The players are taking their seats. Slowly, Andrew walks in.
     Eyes the DRUMS. Takes a deep breath. He can do this...

     Carl is seated in the alternate's seat. The drum throne is
     empty. Just waiting for Andrew...

     Andrew sits down. WE MOVE IN CLOSER ON HIM -- as he adjusts
     his seat, lays his music out, gets his sticks ready...

<b>                            FLETCHER (O.S.)
</b>               Alright, gang.

     Andrew looks up. Fletcher has just entered.

<b>                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               "Whiplash".

     Fletcher eyes Andrew.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Neiman -- just do your best.

     Andrew nods. Looks at the music. Counts in his head. He's
     ready...

     Fletcher CLAPS the band off. WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL
     ANDREW #1, mid-tempo, far easier than before. Andrew's doing
     well. Fletcher nods, smiles--

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Andrew fills, rolling down the toms. Fletcher grins.

Andrew, seeing Fletcher's grin, can't help but smile. Getting
into it now. The whole BAND building, his drumming growing more
intense. He fills again.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Snap! We've got Buddy Rich here.

Andrew grins. Fills again. Accenting, playing a counter-rhythm.
When he trips up. Comes in a hair late.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                 (waving the band to stop)
          Ok, little trouble there. No problem.
          Let's pick it up from 17.

Fletcher claps. Andrew plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND
REHEARSAL ANDREW #2. Fletcher waves him to stop again.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Not my tempo. Ok?

Fletcher claps again. Then another wave for Andrew to stop.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Downbeat on 18. Ok?

He's still soft, calm, warm. He claps again. Then, stopping--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          The "and" of 4. Bar 17, the "and" of 4.

He claps off. Stops Andrew again, only seconds later.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          17, the "and" of 4. Ok? And you're
          rushing a little...

Andrew nods. Getting nervous now... Fletcher claps again. Stops
again.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Not quite my tempo. All good, here we go.

He's about to clap off when, out of nerves, Andrew hits his
bass drum early.

<b>                         FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          No -- ready?

Fletcher claps. Stops Andrew yet again.

          now.
                 (Andrew tries to pull his seat
                  up, getting anxious, flustered)
          All set?

Andrew nods. Get it together... Fletcher claps. Stops.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          You're rushing.

Claps again. Stops again.

<b>                         FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Dragging.

Claps again. Andrew plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL
ANDREW #3, expecting another stop -- but it doesn't come.
Fletcher nods, as though now satisfied, then slowly turns
around. Puts his hand on a spare chair. Looks like he's
about to sit down, when...

...like a flash of lightning he WHIPS up the chair and HURLS
it straight at Andrew's head.

Andrew DUCKS, as the chair CATCHES the top of the bass drum,
almost toppling it over. An EAR-PIERCING CLANG OF CYMBALS, as
Andrew's sticks go flying and the chair hits the floor.

Then -- total silence in the room. Andrew is shell-shocked,
beyond shaken, what in the fuck just happened???...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)

Fletcher BOUNDS up to him, almost RUNNING -- suddenly beast-
like, terrifying, veins set to BURST--

<b>                       FLETCHER

     Then, his PHONE rings. He looks at it. Hesitates...

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>               ...Hello...?

<b>                            JIM (O.S.)
</b>               You didn't show.

     And, finally, breaking down, can't hold it in any longer--

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               He ripped me apart...

<b>                            JIM (O.S.)

                      (then,)
               That asshole? You told me you were
               transferring...

     Andrew looks at his desk. There, atop a pile of papers, is
     his TRANSFER APPLICATION. All filled out. Ready to go. Next
     to it, a BUDDY RICH CD...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>                      (almost to himself)
               ...I thought he liked my playing.

<b>                            JIM (O.S.)
</b>               Who cares what he likes? Who is he to you?
               When I started writing plenty of people
               tried to put me down. You ignore them.

     Andrew is silent. When I started writing...

     Those words seem to have the opposite effect Jim intended.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               When you started writing...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               No, I -- I have to practice...

<b>                            JIM (O.S.)
</b>               No, you have to take it easy.

</b>               I have to go... Sorry. I'll call you
               later.

     He hangs up. Rises. Wipes his reddened eyes. And exits his dorm.

     Andrew steps into Fletcher's office. Before Fletcher can say a
     word--

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               I'm sorry to interrupt you. I just want to
               tell you -- I'm so thankful to have been
               accepted into Studio Band. And I'm going to
               make sure I don't disappoint you.

     Fletcher, seated at his desk, just looks at Andrew. Andrew
     nods, turns around. Marches back down the hall -- as PERCUSSION
     begins... WE FOLLOW HIM, sticking close to his face, the
     resolve now in his eyes. Something has changed.

     PERCUSSION grows louder and, as we move, hurdles us back...

     ...to FLETCHER'S OFFICE. And to Fletcher, peeking out
     through his doorway now. Fletcher smiles...


<b>27   INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - DAY                           27
</b>
     Andrew sits at his drum set, furiously practicing...

     And just like that, moving fast, DRUM PATTERN FOR MONTAGE
     carrying us, we're--


<b>28   INT. GEHRING HALL OFFICE ROOM - DAY                         28
</b>
     CLOSE ON Andrew's hand, Xerox-ing pages of music. The titles:
     "WHIPLASH", "ALEPH NULL", "EASY SIX"... Pages dense with notes...

<b>29   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - SHAFFER CONSERVATORY - EVENING    29
</b>
     Fletcher steps outside. It's drizzling a bit. He slowly unfolds
     an umbrella. Passes by a few other FACULTY MEMBERS on his way
     to the sidewalk. Keeps walking. The DRUMMING continues...


<b>30   INT. DORMITORY - ANDREW'S ROOM - EVENING                 30
</b>
     Andrew pulls the MATTRESS off his bed, drags it to the door
     with his ALARM CLOCK. Heaves both out to the hallway...


<b>31   INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT                                      31
</b>
     Fletcher is seated, squished in between commuters, towered
     over by other travelers. Looks diminutive in this setting...


<b>32   EXT. NEW YORK SIDE STREET - NIGHT                        32
</b>
     Andrew marches down a side-street, wolfing down a McDonald's
     burger for dinner, earphones plugged into a METRONOME...


<b>33   INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - NIGHT                      33
</b>
     Andrew lifts a 50-lb weight with his right arm. Then a 75-lb.
     Then picks his stick up and plays his double-time swing...


<b>34   EXT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT               34
</b>
     Fletcher reaches a nondescript high-rise. With his folded-up
     umbrella, his head hanging low, and the careful delicacy with
     which he opens the door, he looks here like nothing so much
     as a quiet, everyday man...


<b>35   INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - NIGHT                      35
</b>
     Andrew sleeps, earphones still in and metronome still on.
     He's on the MATTRESS he brought down from his dorm, the ALARM
     CLOCK by his side. Next to it, a suitcase of clothes. Above,
     the poster of Buddy Rich. It's as though he's moved in.


<b>36   INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT          36
</b>
     Fletcher sets the table for dinner. He has nice porcelain
     plates, and a glass of red wine. But the meal? A frozen ready-
     made steak and vegetables. On the wall, a photo. In it, a
     younger Fletcher, and a WOMAN, and a NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL. All
     smiles...
                             Pink (9/10/2013)                 39


<b>37   INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - MORNING                    37
</b>
     Andrew rises from the same mattress and slides onto his drum
     seat. Starts playing, hands dotted with blisters, eyes crusty
     with sand. The METRONOME still on...

     ...because it was never turned off.

     CUT TO: Rides furiously, trying to beat his double-time
     swing... The METRONOME reading 380... His muscles exhausted...

     CUT TO: The METRONOME adjusted up to 390... Blisters tearing...

     CUT TO: 400.. Hands bleeding now, blood smearing the sticks...

     CUT TO: 405... The METRONOME going crazy now... The DRUMMING so
     fast it's a wash, a wall of sound, blood on the cymbal--


<b>38   INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT          38
</b>
     Silence. Fletcher finishes his meal. Puts the dishes away. Sits
     down on a couch. Still alone.

     The apartment, like his office, is small but elegant. Pictures
     of icons on the walls. Monk. Holiday. Coltrane...

     Fletcher reaches into a stack of LP's: Chopin, Ravel... Pulls
     one out with the most delicate touch, as though he were
     handling a newborn. Sets it on a record player by his side.

     A scratch, a hiss, and then --

     -- FLETCHER'S SONG. Melancholy, lovelorn...

     Fletcher just sits and listens, barely moves -- but you can
     tell the music now playing means everything to him...

     A moment, and then...

     Wild, feverish, absurdly fast BIG BAND JAZZ. We're on-stage.
     An orchestra about the size of Studio Band is in full swing,
     reaching the end of RIVAL OVERBROOK BAND CHART.

     The band FINISHES. No applause. A card:

     The RIVAL PLAYERS quickly shuffle into the green room, past
     Andrew, who watches, awed. A VOICE--

<b>                              TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
</b>               Terry!

     Andrew turns, glimpses a CORRIDOR through the doorway. Out in
     the corridor, he sees a TECHNICIAN welcome Fletcher. In the
     Technician's arms, a FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL -- the Technician's
     daughter --

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>               Mike!
                      (and, to the girl,)
               I'm so sorry, can I have your autograph?
                      (she blushes, shakes her head)
               Are you playing an instrument yet?

<b>                            TECHNICIAN

                      (to the girl)
               What do you say, you ready for Carnegie
               Hall?

     The Technician smiles again, looks at the girl. She hides her
     face in his chest, embarrassed. He and Fletcher laugh.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Alright, alright.

     He leans in. They hug.

</b>               See you after the show! Cheers!

     He steps in, closes the door and addresses his PLAYERS, who
     are busy sanding their hands, buzzing their lips, preparing:

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Ok, you fucking cocksuckers. E Dorian.

               use these competitions to decide who they
               want. And I am not about to have my
               record in that department stained by a
               bunch of sour-note flexible-tempo flatter-

               demolish you.

     The STAGE HAND nods, slinks away. Fletcher addresses his band--

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Stage right. In order. Now.

     --and opens it to OVERBROOK COMPETITION CHART.

     Fletcher appears. Raises his hand.

     Everyone raises their instruments. Sits still. Waiting...

     A cough is heard. Fletcher looks to his right. The players
     stay still. No sign of whom it came from...

     And then -- the slightest move of Fletcher's index finger. So
     subtle you need absolute focus to even notice it. That's the
     count-off. Miss it and you've blown it for everyone.

     The BAND LAUNCHES. Quiet at first, then a big brassy sound.
     Andrew watches Carl's playing. Taps along on his knees.

Then -- he overhears TALKING...

<b>                          TRUMPETER #1

Andrew turns. Creeps around the corner. Sees a trio of fellow

<b>                          TRUMPETER #2

Andrew leans in to hear more, but before he can get a read--

<b>                          CARL
</b>             I need to look at the music.

Carl is inches from his face. Andrew turns to the chair -- but

<b>                            CARL
</b>               I gave Neiman the folder. Neiman lost it.

     Fletcher looks at Andrew. This is a joke, right?

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Neiman lost it.

<b>                              CARL

                          Pink (9/10/2013)                    45


<b>                            FLETCHER

<b>                            CARL
</b>               You know this... I have -- I need the music,
               my memory -- it's, it needs visual cues--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Visual cues??

<b>                            CARL
</b>               --it's a medical conditio--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               A medical condition? What are you,

<b>                            CARL
</b>               I can't.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               I can.

     Fletcher and Carl both look at him. Neither was expecting him
     to chime in. Andrew seems almost as surprised...

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               You know "Whiplash" by heart?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yes. Every measure. Every note.

     Quickly realizing this is now his only option--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               You'd better pray your memory doesn't
               fail you, Neiman. And I hope you've
               improved since last month's rehearsal. I
               am not about to start losing now.

     Then, to the rest of the band--

</b><b>               ON-FUCKING-STAGE!!

<b>45   INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER         45
</b>
     The PLAYERS in their places. And there, on the set,
     overwhelmed, trying to make this one shot count -- is Andrew.

<b>                            ANNOUNCEMENT
</b>               With their second selection, the Shaffer
               Conservatory Studio Band.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                    46


     Fletcher faces the band. Zeroes in on Andrew. The wild-card.
     Andrew rubs the sweat from his palms. This is it, this is
     it... Adjusts the drums, tightens the snares. Carl sitting
     behind him, burning holes with his eyes...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Five-two-two-six-two-two... Six-two-two...

     Fletcher raises his arm. Hand suspended in air, finger waiting
     to move... Andrew locks eyes on it. Heart pounding now...

     And -- the finger moves. The band begins WHIPLASH OVERBROOK. A
     surging 7/4. Andrew seems caught off-guard at first. Struggles
     to keep up. Then reaches the right speed -- and stays there.
     Fletcher keeps his eye on him, waiting for him to fuck up...

     But Andrew doesn't. He gets the first hit. Awkward, but in
     time. Then the second hit -- also graceless, but on target.

     And here comes the key moment. Fletcher turns his attention
     to the trumpets -- and away from Andrew.

     Barely believing his luck, Andrew plays another bar. Still
     Fletcher doesn't look at him. He's focused on other players.

     The number builds some more. And--

<b>46   INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - STAGE - HOURS LATER           46
</b>
     Applause. Fletcher summons his PLAYERS to the stage. The JUDGE
     hands him the microphone. Fletcher takes it, hesitantly. His
     band behind him -- including Andrew...

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               I'm...supposed to say a few words but...
               it's these kids who should be speaking...
                      (turning to his band, earnestly)
               You earned this, gang.
                      (beat, turns to the audience)
               You know... When I was a kid, I saw God. Or
               as some people know him, Charlie Parker. My
               dad snuck me out of school so we could make
               the drive into Chicago. It was a bar so he
               had to sneak me in, hidden under his coat.
               I didn't know where in the hell I was. I
               was all of seven. But then, by the time I
               was on my third Shirley Temple, this nice-
               looking man went up on-stage and started
               playing. And I've never been the same
               since.

                You guys mean the world to me, you know...
                       (back to the audience)
                I think of them like they were my own kids.
                Treat them that way, too. Treat `em like my
                dad treated me. Meaning I terrorize them.
                       (laughter, and to the band,)
                But it's true, gang. You're my family...

      Something about how Fletcher says this suggests he means it...

<b>                             FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                Thank you. Thank you so much.

      He wavers. Then steps aside and exits with his band.


<b>46A   INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - STAGE - WINGS - CONTINUOUS      46A
</b>
      The STAGE HAND appears, carrying a red folder. Going up to Carl
      and Andrew--

<b>                             STAGE HAND
</b>                This yours? I think a janitor threw it in
                the trash by accident.

      Carl looks. It's his MUSIC FOLDER. He looks behind at Andrew.


<b>47    INT. STUDIO BAND ROOM - GEHRING HALL - DAY                 47
</b>
      A new day of rehearsal. Andrew enters the room, passes the piano--

<b>                             PIANIST
</b>                Don't you go taking my folder...

      Andrew looks at him. Wary, he makes his way to the drums...and
      to Carl. Reaches in to help Carl adjust the cymbals when--

<b>                             CARL
</b>                Do not touch the set.

      Andrew stops. Just then -- the DOOR OPENS, and Fletcher enters.

<b>                             FLETCHER
</b>                "Cherokee".
                       (looks at Carl)
                What are you doing?

      No answer. Carl, seated at the set, is visibly confused.

<b>                             FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                Core only today, I can't waste time
                with alternates.
                            Pink (9/10/2013)                    48


     Carl stays still. What...? Andrew looks just as shocked.

     But Fletcher keeps on staring. He's dead-serious. Finally, Carl
     slides off, stunned, as Andrew takes his place... And, calmly
     tossing this off even though he knows how much it hurts--

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Tanner, make sure to turn Neiman's pages.

     Then he raises his hand. Andrew holds his sticks, still
     shocked. This is as clear a verdict of his playing at
     Overbrook as he'll ever get.

     He's the new core drummer.

     Fletcher CLAPS the band off, and before we hear any music we're--


<b>48   INT. ROAD TO NEW JERSEY - BUS - DAY                        48
</b>
     Andrew watches a VIDEO on his iPhone... It's 70's footage and
     audio of a grey-haired DRUMMER, a face we've seen before...
     BUDDY RICH. Andrew smiles. Relaxed. Proud.

     A bubble pops up: "1 NEW VOICEMAIL, 1 NEW TEXT MESSAGE".

     Andrew opens the text. The name on it: "NICOLE".    It reads:

     "You free Thursday?"

     Andrew is about to answer. Hesitates. Plays the voicemail.

<b>                            CARL (O.S.)
</b>               Neiman... You lost that folder on purpose.
               You knew I didn't know the chart by
               heart... Answer me... I've been core for
               two years. I've been drumming since I was
               three. I earned my spot you asshol--

     Andrew hangs up. Looks back at the text message. Considering
     again...

     Then he just resumes watching the video.


<b>49   INT. NEW JERSEY - JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING          49

     Jim grabs a platter from the stove, Andrew by his side.

<b>                            JIM

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Good. I think he likes me more now.

<b>                            JIM
</b>               His opinion means a lot to you, doesn't it?

     Jim looks at Andrew. Almost accusatory. A moment...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah...

<b>                            JIM

<b>50   INT. JIM'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                    50

     Seven people seated at the table: Jim and Andrew, Andrew's
     uncle FRANK, aunt EMMA, and 18-year-old cousin DUSTIN. To Jim--

<b>                            UNCLE FRANK
</b>               Jimbo -- overcooked!
                      (to Emma, laughing re: the meat)
               I can barely chew this thing.

     Jim laughs along. Andrew watches. There's an undercurrent to
     the joking. The power dynamic between the brothers is clear.

<b>                            UNCLE FRANK (CONT'D)
</b>               He just laughs.

     Jim keeps laughing.

<b>                            AUNT EMMA
</b>               And how's your drumming going, Andy?

     Andrew, put on the spot, hesitates. But then, excited--

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Well... Actually, it's...it's going
               really well. I'm now the core drum--

     The door OPENS. In steps TRAVIS, another cousin, 21, football
     player, real looker. All eyes swerve in an instant from
     Andrew to him.

<b>                            UNCLE FRANK

</b>          Did you hear, Jimmy?

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK
</b>          They named Trav the season's MVP.

<b>                       JIM

Beat. Then--

<b>                       AUNT EMMA (CONT'D)
</b>          And Andrew. With his drumming.

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (a little peeved,)
          It's going spectacularly well, actually.
          I'm...I'm in Shaffer's top jazz
          orchestra, it's the best in the country --
          and I was just made a core member.
                 (there's no reaction)
          ...Which means I play in competitions.
          I'm one of the youngest they have.

<b>                       TRAVIS

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          ...No, not really.

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK
</b>          Does the studio help get you a job?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          It's...it's not a studio, that's just the
          name of the ensemble... And yes, it's a
          big step forward in my career.

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK

Andrew glances at his dad. Wondering if maybe he'll chime in
in defense... But no. His dad stays meek and quiet.

<b>                       AUNT EMMA
</b>          I saw a TV commercial for credit reports
          where a young man was playing the drums.
          You could do that.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Yes, or the Lincoln Center Jazz
          Orchestra. But the credit reports gig is
          a wonderful backup.

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK
</b>                 (missing Andrew's sarcasm)
          Well I'm glad you have it figured out. It's
          a nasty business, I'm sure.
                 (to Travis)
          Oh, you gotta tell them about your game last
          week. I'd say you lived up to your title.

<b>                       TRAVIS

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK

          way to the pros.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          It's Division III.

Everyone at the table looks at Andrew -- including his dad.

          It's not even Division II.

          The tilapia is delicious, by the way.

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK
</b>          Well who will you play with otherwise?
          Who'll give you your break? Lennon and

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Charlie Parker didn't know anyone `til Jo

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Becoming the greatest musician of the
          twentieth century would be anyone's idea
          of success.

<b>                       JIM
</b>          Dying broke, drunk, and full of heroin at
          34 would not be my idea of success.

Andrew turns and looks at his dad. Can't believe he joined in.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (to his dad)
          I'd rather die broke and drunk at 34 and
          have people at a dinner table somewhere
          talk about it than die rich and sober at
          90 and have no one remember me.

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK
</b>          Ah, but friends remember you. That's the
          whole point.

          loved and included.

</b>          I prefer to feel hated and cast out. It
          gives me purpose.

<b>                       ANDREW

          you think you're better than us?

</b>          Well I've got a reply for you, Andrew.
          You think Carleton football's a joke?
                 (Andrew only nods)
          Come play with us.

<b>                       JIM
</b>          And from Lincoln Center?

A moment of silence. Andrew looks at his dad, and his dad
just looks right back... A simmering anger in his eyes,
Andrew turns to the others, and, slowly--

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          In 1967 a scientist named Laszlo Polgar
          decides to prove talent isn't about what
          you're born with but about conditioning.
          Has three kids, Susan, Sophia and Judit,
          and gets them practicing chess for hours
          and hours before they can even talk.
          Fifteen years later Susan and Sophia are
          the two top female players in the world,
          and Judit's on her way to entering the
          history books as the greatest female
          chess master of all time.

Silence once again. Andrew glances at his dad, and delivers
back that same accusatory look he saw in the kitchen...

<b>                       UNCLE FRANK
</b>          So not only do you want to die at 34,
          broke, drunk, and addicted to heroin, but
          you also wish you were a lab rat.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                    54


     Andrew says nothing. Rises, plate in hand. Walks to the door--

<b>                            DUSTIN
</b>               Enjoy band camp.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Enjoy pretending you're an ambassador.

     --and swings it shut behind him.


<b>51   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                   51
</b>
<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Ok, I'm going to just lay it out. This is
               why I don't think we should be together.

     We're back in the city, at a coffee shop. Andrew is seated
     across from Nicole, who just looks at him. Clearly she did
     not think this is how the conversation would begin.

<b>                            ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>               I've thought about this a lot. If we're
               together this is what's going to happen.
               I'm going to keep pursuing what I'm
               pursuing, and it's going to take up more
               and more of my time. You're going to see
               me less and less. When you do, I'll be
               distracted, I'll be upset, I'll be
               playing things in my mind. And you're
               going to just grow to resent me. At a
               certain point, you'll tell me to ease up
               on the drumming, to spend more time with
               you. And I won't be able to. And I'll
               start to resent you for even asking me
               that. I'll feel like you're dragging me
               down, you'll feel like you don't matter --
               and before long, we'll hate each other.
               So I think we should just cut it off now,
               cleanly, for those reasons.

     A beat. Nicole is silent. Finally, Andrew adds--

<b>                            ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>               Because I want to be great.

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               And you're not.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               I want to be one of the greats.

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               And I would stop you from doing that.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                       55


<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yes.

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               You know I would stop you from doing
               that. You know that for a fact.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yes.

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               And I would barely see you anyway.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               That's right.

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               And when I did see you, you would treat
               me like shit, because I'm some girl who
               doesn't know what she wants, and you have
               a path, and you're going to be great, and
               I'm going to be forgotten, and therefore
               you won't be able to give me the time of
               day because you have bigger things to
               pursue.

<b>                            ANDREW 
</b>               That's right. That's exactly my point.

     Beat.

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               You're right. We should not be dating.

     She gets up.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               I'm glad we had this talk.

<b>                            NICOLE
</b>               Me too.

     With that, she turns and leaves. We linger on Andrew, the
     look on his face... Did I just fuck up...? No, I'm good.


<b>52   INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - DAY                  52
</b>
     A BLAST of music. Horns squealing, cymbals swelling.

     It's another Studio Band rehearsal. Andrew's at the drums,
     playing well. Fletcher cues a fermata, and the band
     finishes STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL AFTER-BREAKUP CHART.
                       Pink (9/10/2013)                   56


<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Alright, gang. Pick up the new chart by
          the door. Rehearsal tonight starts at 9.
          You have `til then to learn it.

PLAYERS head out. Andrew grabs his copy of the chart -- it's
called "CARAVAN" -- when--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Neiman. Stay a bit, ok?

Andrew nods. Carl, at the door, glares at him. Then slinks off.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                 (approaching, pointing to the chart)
          Look at this. See the tempo?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Quarter note 330...

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          That's a double-time swing. That's what
          got you in here, isn't it?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I guess so...

Fletcher grins. Then -- the smile fades.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Now, just as was the case with you, I
          stumbled on a kid practicing his double-
          time swing the other night. I'd like to
          give him a shot.

Before Andrew can register, let alone ask "Who?"--

<b>                        RYAN (O.S.)
</b>          Am I late?

Fletcher and Andrew turn to the door. RYAN CONNOLLY is here.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Perfect timing! Join us, Connolly.
                 (Ryan heads over, smiling)
          You two know each other, don't you?

<b>                       RYAN
</b>          Yep, Nassau Band. `Sup, Andrew...

Ryan is all smiles. But Andrew is mortified. Can barely
conceal his anxiety -- and his anger.
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                    57


<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Now, Connolly, I've made Andrew a
          temporary core--
                 (Andrew's eyes shoot up at
                  the word "temporary")
          --but we've got the competition this
          weekend and I want to make sure the new
          chart's in good shape.

Ryan nods, reaches into his backpack. And, to Andrew's shock,
pulls out the "new chart". CARAVAN.

<b>                       RYAN
</b>          This one, right?

Andrew's wide-eyed. When did he get the chart?

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>                 (as though he can read his mind)
          I gave it to him this morning, Neiman.
          Now, all I want to do is test out the
          part. Neiman, if you wouldn't mind, could
          we take it from the top with just you?

Andrew tries to keep calm. Goes to the drums, lays out the
chart.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't worry, I don't care about hits.
          That'll be tonight. For now, just tempo.

Andrew nods. Takes a deep breath. Looks at the tempo notation.
"330". Another breath. Ok... I've got this... Fletcher CLAPS.
Andrew BEGINS.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          No... That's not quite my tempo...

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I'm -- I'm sorry -- I'll--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Let's see if Connolly can do it, ok?

Beat. Andrew looks at Ryan. Heart pounding, he switches with
him. Fletcher CLAPS. Ryan BEGINS. And he plays perfectly.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Connolly -- that was excellent. See,
          this is the beauty of Studio Band. You
          come in an alternate -- but a minute
          later, you could be the new core.

Andrew's eyes widen again.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                       58


<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               You're not serious.

     Fletcher looks at Andrew -- as though shocked Andrew talked
     back. A moment of silence. Then -- BZZZZZ. Fletcher's cell.

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Connolly, the chart's yours. See you
               both tonight at 9.
                      (answering the phone)
               Hi, this is Terence...

     He heads to his OFFICE. Andrew is still. What just happened...?

<b>                            RYAN
</b>               How you been, bro?
                      (Andrew looks at Ryan)
               I think it was the injury that kept me out
               last time. But I'm fuckin' stoked to be
               joining you guys now.

     Andrew just stares. Ryan seems earnest -- but Andrew is incensed.

<b>                            RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>                      (mistaking Andrew's look for
                       anxiety)
               Don't worry about Fletch, either. My
               granddad knew his dad from the
               Philharmonic when Fletcher was trying to
               break in. He's more bark than bite.

     Andrew's eyes really widen now: What the fuck is going on?

     He gets up, marches to Fletcher's door, and--


<b>53   INT. GEHRING HALL - FLETCHER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS          53
</b>
     --BURSTS in. Fletcher's just finished his call.

<b>               FLETCHER                         ANDREW
</b>     What are--?                     I need to talk to you.

<b>               FLETCHER                         ANDREW
</b>     Now is not the time, I          I can play that part, you
     swear to God--                  know I can--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               I said NOT NOW!!!

     There's more desperation in Fletcher's voice than anger. And
     Andrew notices something else: Fletcher's eyes are watering...
     Andrew is silent. He's never seen Fletcher like this.
                           Pink (9/10/2013)                    59

                You want the part? Then...earn it.

      A moment passes.


<b>54    INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS        54

      Andrew busts back through the STUDIO BAND ROOM. Eyes burning.
      One thought and one thought only: Get that part back.

<b>                             RYAN
</b>                Bro! Wanna grab lunch?

      But Andrew doesn't answer. Just keeps walking.


<b>54A   INT. DORMITORY - BASEMENT BATHROOM - DAY                54A

      Andrew pours ice into a sink. Turns on the faucet. Dips a big
      glass jug in and collects ice water.


<b>55    INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - DAY                        55

      Andrew practices the part... He's pushing, giving it his all...
      "CARAVAN" on his stand, scribbled over with pencil markings:
      "forte", "triplets!", "hemiola 1-3", "don't slow down!"

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                Come on... Come on...

      He stops. His hand throbbing from blisters. He dips it by his
      side -- into the jug of ICE WATER. Clenches. Blood clouds the
      water.

      He resumes playing -- frenzied, exhausted. Fucks up, screams out--

<b>                             ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>                Fuck!!!!

      Starts pounding his stick against the drum-head. Then his hand.
      Pounding harder and harder, once, twice, three times, four
      times. Hand bleeding more, the drum-skin giving way, finally
      tearing and breaking.

      He STARTS PLAYING again, fed up, enraged, SHOUTING at himself--

<b>                             ANDREW (CONT'D)

     A crowded subway car. Andrew is seated, poring over his sheet
     music, running through the beats in his head...


<b>57   INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - NIGHT             57
</b>
     The PLAYERS sit silently. Ryan on the drum throne, Carl and
     Andrew behind him -- Carl still humiliated, Andrew 100%
     focused. The clock reads: 9:00. Not a word in the room.

     Fletcher emerges. A CD PLAYER in his hand. He plugs it in.

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>               Ok... Um...

     For the first time ever, he seems uneasy, unsure what to say.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               We...we have a new player. Ryan Connolly.

     Ryan nods, waves to the other PLAYERS. Chipper--

<b>                              RYAN
</b>               Sup, dudes.

     Andrew glares at him. Seething now. But, continuing, softly--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               But I...if you could just...put your
               instruments down... Just for a second...

     He turns to the CD player. Turns it on. A big-band ballad
     swells. A muted trumpet takes the lead. It's CASEY'S SONG,
     and it's a tender sound, full of melancholy...

     For a few seconds, Fletcher doesn't say a word. His thoughts
     seem to be drifting. Then, hesitant, as the music plays...

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Six years ago...I saw a kid practicing
               scales in a band room here. He'd started at
               Shaffer with a lot of hope, but the truth
               was he'd barely squeaked in and he was
               struggling. Everyone on the faculty told
               him: "This isn't for you." But they didn't
               see what I saw...
                      (his voice croaking again,

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          And I put him in Studio Band, and we
          worked together for three years, and when
          he graduated, Marsalis made him third
          trumpet at Lincoln Center. A year later,
          he was first. That's who you're hearing
          now.
                 (then,)
          His name was Sean Casey.

The name catches Andrew's attention. The trumpeter Fletcher
mentioned to him... And the word "was"...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I found out this morning...that Sean died.
          He died in a car accident yesterday...
                 (takes a moment, is having
                  trouble speaking)
          I just wanted you guys to know that...
          He was... Sean was a...
                 (and, almost dissolving into
                  tears on these next words)
          ...beautiful player...
                 (breathes in, collects himself)
          I just thought you all should know.

Beat. He leans back down and turns off the CD. Silence.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                 (another moment; then, still shaky--)
          "Caravan". From bar 142, please.

The PLAYERS open their folders, pick up their instruments.
Fletcher waits. Hesitates again... Then -- CLAPS. Just drums,
bass and trombone play the trombone solo section of CARAVAN
STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL. Fast, precise -- but Fletcher waves to
Ryan to stop.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          No, that's...that's not quite right,
          Connolly... Sorry...

Andrew's eyes instantly fill with hope. Is this his chance?

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I... I want to try Neiman on this... Ok?

Ryan nods, slowly slides off -- as Andrew quickly gets on.
Clutches his sticks tight. This is it... Fletcher's still shaky--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Maybe...maybe now's the time for Neiman
          to earn the part...

Beat. He CLAPS off, Andrew starts, and, only ONE SECOND later--
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                      62


<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          No, I guess not. Tanner.

An anger is creeping into Fletcher's voice now. The
stammering fading away, bit by bit. Dismayed, Andrew gets
off, Carl gets on, Fletcher CLAPS him off -- and then,
SLAMMING his fist down on his table, the barely suppressed
grief giving way now to terrifying, full-out rage--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Mother-FUCKER!!!

Carl JUMPS. The band goes silent. Fletcher glares at his
drummers, eyes so heated they could burn holes into you.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Get your ass back on the kit, Connolly.

Ryan does. The other players are still. Real fear in the room...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I will find my tempo out of one of you
          faggots if it takes me all goddamned night.

His tone is vicious, his eyes still watery. He CLAPS, stops--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Which it just might. Neiman.

Andrew gets on. His hands are shaking. Fletcher CLAPS, stops--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Not my tempo. Switch.

Carl gets back on. Fletcher CLAPS, stops yet again--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Not my FUCKING tempo!!!!

He turns to the rest of the band. Rubs his eyes, breathes, and
then, trying to keep calm but his face already beet-red...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Ok... Sorry about this, gang, hate to put
          you through it. But rest your arms, put
          aside your instruments, if you need to
          take a dump do it now, `cause I am going
          to go for as long as it takes until I
          find a drummer who can play in time.
                 (to the drummers--)
          You hear me talking, cocksuckers? You'd
          better start shitting me perfect 400's.
          Connolly. You first. Get on the kit.

<b>58   INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - LATER              58
</b>
     PLAYERS mull through the hall, stretching. A few yawns. You can
     tell these guys have been here for hours already... And through
     the wall, the kind of screaming that shakes you to your core:

<b>                            FLETCHER (O.S.)
</b>               Motherfucking COCKSUCKER!!! Is--

               worthless acne-scarred fetal-position
               Hymie fuck. GET OFF!!!

     Andrew -- whole body shaking, had been playing for half an
     hour straight -- gets off the kit, struggling for breath,
     hands coated with torn blisters and blood. Fletcher's rage is
     unlike anything we've seen from him: pained, vengeful...

     Carl gets on the kit. Fletcher CLAPS. The clock: 11:06.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Well what do we have here? Gay Pride

               concert, Tanner. I am sorry to inform you
               we will not be serving Baked Alaska and
               Cosmopolitans tonight. Now why don't you

<b>               FUCKING KIT!!!
</b>
     Carl stops. Staggers back, dazed, as Ryan moves up and begins.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Now we got ourselves our mick fucking paddy-

     PLAYERS rinse their faces. One looks at his watch, dead-tired.
     It's very late...


<b>61   INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - NIGHT              61
</b>
     Some players have now returned to their seats.
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                    64


<b>                         FLETCHER
</b>          Switch!

Carl stops playing. Almost falls as he gets off the kit. Ryan
takes his place -- just as worn out. As soon as he sits down
at the set he has to bend down to catch his breath.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          It is not Saint fucking Patrick's Day,
          Flannery, there is not a pot of gold
          under your fucking seat. Play.

Fletcher CLAPS. Ryan plays, muscles cramping, can't keep up--

<b>                         FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Switch!

Ryan stops, gasping. Fletcher's eyes land...

...ON ANDREW. Face awash in sweat, hair dripping, muscles
throbbing, wrists red, hands caked in blood, T-shirt clinging
to his chest. This is it...

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (muttering to himself as he
                  gets on the kit)
          Come on... Come on you fuck...

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Let's see if we can finally bring this
          home.

He CLAPS. Andrew begins.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't slow down.

Andrew tries, the tempo slips... So fast, so loud...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Speed up! God-fucking-damnit I said SPEED
<b>          UP!!!
</b>
Andrew's arms are moving as fast as they possibly can, his
feet like triggers -- and his ears start RINGING now, the
RINGING cutting and almost drowning out the other sounds...

Fletcher, fire-eyed, turns around and goes into the nearest
CLOSET. Emerges with a COWBELL and a STICK. Comes closer and
BANGS ON IT in time. The SOUND slices through the RINGING,
startles Andrew, this stick whacking down inches from his head--

<b>                         FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't stop!!
                             Pink (9/10/2013)                    65


     Andrew doesn't stop. Manages to glare forward, with what
     almost seems like hatred in his tired, blood-shot eyes...

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Faster!... Faster!!
                      (Andrew speeds up)
               Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
               One! One! One! One! One! One! One! One!

     Andrew slips, almost loses the beat. Fletcher GRABS the FLOOR
     TOM DRUM and HURLS it through the air, against the nearest
     wall. It RAMS into the concrete, handles buckling. But Andrew
     stays focused. Doesn't cry.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b><b>               KEEP PLAYING!!
</b>
     Andrew does. Fletcher raises the COWBELL now, about to STRIKE
     Andrew across the head, looks like a fucking madman -- but
     still Andrew does not cry -- as Fletcher BELLOWS--

<b>                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b><b>               KEEP PLAYING!!!
</b>     Andrew keeps playing.

     Fletcher stands still. Stares at him. Circles the drum set
     like a predatory beast, ready to strike at any instant.

     Then -- he steps back. Drops   the cowbell and stick. Andrew is
     still playing, going like an   automaton. No tears. Finally,
     Fletcher silently raises his   hand, and, with just a slight
     wave, gestures for Andrew to   stop.

     Andrew does. Nearly collapses over the set.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Congratulations, Neiman. You earned the part.

     He turns to the rest of the band.

<b>                            FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Ok. Now we can begin.

     It's 3:30am. The PLAYERS stagger out of the building. Zombies.

     Andrew appears, red-eyed, past exhaustion. Fletcher emerges last.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                    66

               travel receipts. Or don't, I don't give a
               fuck.

     He then walks off. Andrew watches him leave. And, as we zero in
     on Andrew's eyes...

     ...we see that something fundamental has changed.

     He looks like a completely different person now. 100% hollowed
     out.

     It's Andrew. Hunched over sheet music, earphones on, counting
     aloud through "CARAVAN". And, by his side -- a Zip-lock bag of
     PILLS. Just like the ones we saw exchanged at the party outside
     his dorm...

     PASSENGERS look at him. Who is this lunatic...?

     And suddenly -- A JOLT. The bus ROCKS to the side, lights go
     out, the wheels SCREECH to an abrupt stop. Andrew removes his
     earphones.


<b>65   EXT. ROAD TO DUNELLEN - GREYHOUND BUS - DAY                    65

     The side of the road. Andrew and the other PASSENGERS stand
     outside, waiting, the BUS's right tire blown, a rod lodged
     into its side. Andrew checks his phone for the time. Fuck...

     A nondescript Jersey town. A NEW BUS comes to a stop, setting
     down passengers on Dunellen's Main Street. Andrew bolts off,
     carrying his stick bag and music folder. Looks around.
     Perplexed. Grabs a PASSERBY--

     Five blocks later -- Andrew dashes across a patch of grass,
     reaches a door, grabs the handle. The door won't open. He goes
     white. Sees the HOURS sign. Eyes scroll down. Starts POUNDING--

      Andrew finishes signing paperwork. Grabs his MUSIC FOLDER and

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Like fucking hell he is.

     Fletcher looks at him. Stunned. The PLAYERS also look shocked.

He marches toward Andrew. Looms over him, seems about to hit him.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)

          can or cannot do you weepy-willow shitsack?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          When I earned that part.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Earned? You've never earned a thing. The
          only reason you're a fucking core is
          because you misplaced a folder. The only
          reason you're in Studio Band is because I
          told you what I'd be asking for in Nassau.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Bullshit. I'm in Studio Band because--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          You realize I can cut you anytime I feel.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          You would've cut me by now.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Try me you weasel. At 5:30, that's in
          eleven minutes, my band is on-stage. You're
          not there with your own sticks, or you show
          up and make a single mistake -- a single
          one -- and I'll send you back to Nassau
          Band to turn pages until you graduate or
          drop out. For extra kicks, I'll spread the
          word on just how you became a Studio Band
          core, and by the time my sewing circle is
          done you'll make your dad look like a
          success story.
                 (lets that linger, then,)
          Or I can give "Johnny Utah" the part and
          we'll leave it at that. Your choice.

      Beat. Andrew catches sight of Carl, standing in the back,
      watching -- and almost smiling. He turns back to Fletcher--

      He hangs up. Enraged. Slams down on the gas, engine roaring...

      PICKING UP SPEED... The GPS says "2 minutes" left... The clock
      turns 5:32...

      The speedometer SHOOTING UP... UP... UP...

      The car reaching a STOP SIGN...but Andrew keeps going, not
      looking...

      His car SPEEDING UP and SPEEDING UP until it's--

<b>      --SLAMMED INTO.
</b>
      Glass flying everywhere, everything going so fast, as though
      the vehicle had just been whipped up by a tornado...

      The car FLIPS, 180, the top crunching down like paper, Andrew
      spun around and shoved up against it -- bleeding, battered--

      --until the car comes to a stop, upside down. Glass and blood.

      Silence.

      Andrew takes a moment to understand what has just happened.
      Gasping for breath, he yanks himself up -- but finds his LEFT
      HAND is caught under the steering wheel. He yanks, pulls at
      it. It won't budge. Smoke and exhaust fumes billow up...

      He tugs and tugs and pulls and -- finally -- CRAAAACK -- the
      bone of his index finger SNAPS. The most painful sound you can
      imagine. He SCREAMS in agony. YANKS back, staggering...
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                      73


     His hand is free. Bone broken, bleeding profusely.

     Andrew crawls out of the car... Rises to his feet... Dizzy, the
     world spinning... The TRUCK DRIVER who rammed into him is running
     over--

<b>                            TRUCK DRIVER

</b>               No -- stay away from the car, it's not sa--

     Andrew blocks him out. Reaches with his right hand -- the
     working one -- and goes for the STICK BAG, sandwiched between
     the caved-in top and the seat. Groaning in pain as he
     reaches... Gets it.

     Still running, has been running for three blocks... Out of
     breath, even dizzier than before... Reaches the front green,
     face coated in sweat, and hand drenched in blood... Almost
     collapses... A couple of PASSERSBY see him, shocked--

      Dashes in from backstage. The PLAYERS have taken their places,
      finished tuning, are about to perform. Andrew sees Fletcher.
      Fletcher sees him. Hiding his arm behind his stick bag--

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

      Doesn't even wait for Fletcher's answer, goes straight to the
      set where Ryan is seated. Nothing is going to stop him now--

<b>                             ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>                Get off. Get off the fucking set.

      Ryan looks at Fletcher. Fletcher waits -- then nods, almost
      smiling. Seems he's having fun with this. Ryan slides off,
      pissed, and takes a seat next to Carl. Andrew takes his place.

      His left hand still hidden, Andrew props up his music and
      pulls out a pair of sticks. Tries to hold his left stick
      properly -- but it keeps giving way. With his index finger
      broken, it's impossible to keep the stick steady...

      He looks at the music: "Caravan"... Looks back at his hand...
      Tries to move his left fingers, mimicking the stick patterns...
      Just up ahead -- Fletcher. Animal intensity...

      Andrew closes his eyes... Tries to block out the anxiety...
      The pain... The stress that just keeps mounting and mounting...
      Gropes inside his STICK BAG. Pulls out his bag of pills. Drops
      it. Pills scatter. Picks a pill up, pops it, out of sight.

<b>                             ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
</b>                The Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band...

      Fletcher raises his hand, ready to cue... Andrew tries to get
      his breathing under control... Ryan and Carl lean forward...
      Ryan catches a glimpse of Andrew's left hand, just as...

      ...Fletcher's finger MOVES.

      THE BAND IS OFF. It explodes into CARAVAN DUNELLEN at lightning-
      speed.

      But Andrew is already in trouble... Blood getting on the
      snare... Ears starting to RING... Left hand barely keeping
      up... The whole thing slowly slipping away from him...

      He closes his eyes. Mouths: "Come on come on come on..."
                      Pink (9/10/2013)                   75


A big FILL coming up. He needs both his hands. Launches into
it -- and his left stick CATCHES the edge of a stand...

...AND GOES FLYING. Falling and sliding under the hi-hat pedal.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (still riding with his right hand)
          Stick...

Carl stays still. Andrew looks at him. But Carl won't move.

Panicked, Andrew turns, eyes his old Nassau Band peer -- Ryan.

<b>                       ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          Ryan... Stick...

Ryan hesitates. Doesn't want to think of himself as a
saboteur. But he looks at Carl, Carl looks back at him...and
right then and there he makes his choice.

<b>                       ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          Please...

Neither Carl nor Ryan moves.

Andrew, thinking fast, eyes the fallen stick. Trying as hard as
he can to keep that tempo going with his right hand, he slides
down the left side of his body, stretching his arm as far as it
can go... His broken finger grazing the stick... Grabbing hold...

Pulls up -- and -- another CRAAAAAACK as his finger is caught
against the hi-hat pedal and the bone is bent 90 degrees. He
GASPS, almost cries out in pain. Has to hold it in.

Pulls himself back up to the set -- and there, looming over him
already, is Fletcher. Eyes fiery--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          The fuck are you doing...???

Andrew keeps playing. But the PAIN is harder and harder to
ignore. His snare drum completely smeared in red now, his
stick stained, his whole arm shaking. And that RINGING -- just
growing and growing, drowning out everything else...

He looks at the SHEET MUSIC, suddenly lost... The horns blast
out a hit -- but Andrew isn't on it. Fuck. Launches into another
fill -- and hits the crash at the wrong time.

Fletcher stares at him. The look says it all: it's over. But
Andrew keeps fighting. Another missed hit, then a missed time-
signature change, the beat falling apart beneath his feet. Total
chaos, and then, finally, the sign of death -- Andrew STOPS.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                    76


     Almost immediately, the rest of the band grinds to a halt. It's
     a horrible sound, like a car screeching, nails on a chalkboard.

     Fletcher stands in place, eyes on Andrew. In fact, all eyes are
     on Andrew. The theater is dead-silent. Disbelief everywhere.

     Calmly, Fletcher approaches Andrew and whispers one last thing:

<b>                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>               You're done.

     Then he turns around. Andrew start shaking, his eyes brimming
     -- and, suddenly, something takes over inside. Almost despite
     himself, he RISES -- and KICKS OVER THE DRUMS.

     Cymbals CRASH to the wooden stage-floor like bombs. Andrew
     CHARGES forward -- and, just as Fletcher turns to him, TACKLES
     the man to the ground...

     Andrew goes absolutely batshit crazy on Fletcher, murder in his
     eyes... Raises his fists, about to POUND into Fletcher's face,
     when SECURITY GUARDS yank him off, pulling him away in a flash...

     Torn from his target, Andrew breaks down into TEARS. Every-
     thing inside him spilling out like water. Fletcher, stunned but
     uninjured, gets back on his feet. His shirt drips with blood --
     not his own, but Andrew's. A SECURITY GUARD rushes onto the
     scene, and Andrew, kicking and screaming, is DRAGGED OFF...

     We linger inside the theater. A hush over the audience, the
     players and their instruments. And then, a card:

     Lets his eyes take in one item at a time: A drum pad on the

     from Shaffer.

     tearing up, watches...

     Pulls the DVD out. SNAPS it in half. Tosses the halves in
     the trash. Slides the drum pad and metronome into the
     trash as well. Ties the trash bag and pulls it out.

     the cymbals come off, then the pedals, then the toms...

     A look of resolution on his face -- and, bubbling up,
     anger... He tears at the drums as though attacking them,
     pulls them apart almost viciously, one part after another...
     Then the Buddy Rich POSTER -- which he rips to shreds...

     Sits down on the hallway floor, the drum parts stacked to

     breath out...

          don't want to file suit.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Then what do they want?

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT
</b>          To make sure Terence Fletcher is never
          allowed to do this to another student.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          He didn't do anything.

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT
</b>          So President Kohn and Dean Pence will tell
          you. To them, Fletcher is Shaffer.

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT (CONT'D)
</b>          But if they think we have a case like this
          and can win in court, they'll have no
          choice but to let him go before we do.

Beat. Andrew looks at her. Then at his dad.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Well, I have nothing to say.

Jim leans forward now, taking the initiative--

<b>                       JIM
</b>          Andrew... It's over, ok...? He's out of
          your life. Why let him get away with what
          he did to you?

He eyes Rachel. Ok...? Was that the right thing to say...?

Andrew stays silent.

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT
</b>          Would you characterize his conduct as
          extreme, Andrew? Did he ever intentionally
          inflict emotional distress?

Still Andrew doesn't respond. Feels his dad's stare on
him as well now.

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT (CONT'D)
</b>                 (trying to persuade--)
          This would not be a public hearing, you
          know... Fletcher would never know it was
          you who spoke up.

Andrew looks at the glass of water in front of him. Untouched.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          ...What would happen to him?

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT
</b>          Shaffer will do anything to prevent this
          from going to court. Yours won't be the
          first complaint, but I think it'll tip
          the balance. You're recent.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          You tried other students?

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT
</b>          Some -- but you guys are walls.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          And you thought I'd talk.

<b>                       RACHEL BORNHOLDT
</b>          You have nothing to gain from Fletcher
          anymore.

A beat. Andrew turns his eyes to his dad. Anger in his gaze--

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Why did you do this...?

Jim seems taken aback. Flustered for a second. Then--

<b>                       JIM
</b>          You think I was going to let him put my
          son through hell and walk off scot-free?

Andrew turns away. Jim can see the hurt on his son's face.
The sense of betrayal. Worried, trying to reach out--

<b>                       JIM (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't you know I would never let that
          happen, Andrew? That there's nothing in
          the world more important to me than you?
                 (beat; Andrew evades his gaze)
          Don't you know that?

A moment. Andrew looks at his dad again.

Then he stares ahead. WE PUSH in on him, slowly -- as he
drifts deeper into thought, trying to sort through it
all...

<b>                        RACHEL BORNHOLDT (O.S.)

Andrew can barely hear her...

Defeated, his soul split in two... Finally -- he gives up.

</b>          Just tell me what to say.

<b>86   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - BILLBOARD STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 86
</b>
     Summer in New York. Tube tops, street performers, sunshine.

     Andrew, hand healed, carries laundry. Looks up and sees a huge
     sign: "BACK IN NYC! JVC JAZZ FESTIVAL June 21-29". We're in the
     Lower East Side -- far, far away from Shaffer...


<b>87   INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON     87
</b>
     A new apartment. Andrew's dad is already inside, sliding
     groceries into the fridge when Andrew enters.

<b>                            JIM
</b>               Hey, buddy. You ready?


<b>88   INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON     88
</b>
     Blinds closed, as Andrew and Jim sit and watch "North by
     Northwest" on TV. We PAN from a few college applications on a
     table, past the walls -- no decorations at all -- to Andrew and
     Jim seated.

     We linger on Andrew's face. There's a sadness in his eyes. He
     looks tired, even after months, and resigned.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                      83


     Jim laughs at a line in the movie. Glances over at his son,
     wants to see if he's enjoying himself. Hands him some popcorn.
     A beat.


<b>89   INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING            89
</b>
     Father and son stand by the doorway, Jim about to exit--

<b>                            JIM
</b>               "Dr. No" next week. Or whatever's playing
               on 86th...?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               ...I'd rather do it here.

<b>                            JIM
</b>               Ok. I stacked your pantry with Gushers.

     Andrew manages a smile. A moment passes between them.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Thanks, Dad...

     Jim exits. Andrew hangs back. A moment...

     Then, Andrew glances down at his phone. Scrolls to a specific
     number: "NICOLE".

     He looks at it. Thinking. Finger hovering over it...

     Then, too scared, he pulls back. Pockets the phone.


<b>90   INT. SANDWICH SHOP - DAY                                   90
</b>
     Andrew makes a ham sandwich, employee's apron on. Hands it
     silently to a CUSTOMER.


<b>91   INT. JIM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       91
</b>
     Uncle Frank, Jim, and Travis sit on the couch watching a
     hockey game on TV. They laugh and cheer, as Andrew sits off to
     the side, also watching -- his mind far away.


<b>92   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT                   92
</b>
     Andrew walks alone, eating a slice of pizza. Crosses by a
     STREET PERFORMER -- a man drumming away on a row of buckets.
     Doesn't watch, just keeps walking.
                           Pink (9/10/2013)                    84


      We follow, as Andrew passes a JAZZ CLUB on the next block.
      Suddenly -- he stops.

      There, on the club's main sign, below the featured names, are
      these words: "Guest Performer: TERENCE FLETCHER". Andrew stays
      put for a second. Completely taken aback. Then he starts
      walking away. Then stops. Nope. Turns around...


<b>93    INT. JAZZ CLUB - MOMENTS LATER                           93
</b>
      ...and steps inside. It's a genteel venue. On the stage, BASS,
      DRUMS, BONGOS -- and, at the piano, FLETCHER.

      The mere sight gets Andrew's pulse racing. But he stays put.
      Watches... The quartet is pacing its way through FLETCHER'S
      SONG IN CLUB, and Fletcher is playing the final head. He's
      exceedingly delicate, gentle with each keystroke, his fingers
      moving like ballerinas. His playing is soft, subtle, and
      exquisite. He plays the melody as though moved by it.

      Andrew is surprised by this... Stays in the back, behind the
      last table. The song comes to a close. Fletcher smiles, looks --
      and then freezes. His eyes locked on Andrew. He has seen him.

      Andrew blanches, takes a step back, hurries for the exit. But
      there's a PERSON blocking the way. Tries to squeeze through--

<b>                             DRUMMER (O.S.)
</b>                That was Terence Fletcher, on the keys...

      More applause. Andrew, hemmed in, keeps trying to get out--

<b>                               FLETCHER
</b>                Neiman.

      Andrew stops. Turns. Fletcher is standing right there. A moment
      of silence. Andrew is pale. But Fletcher's face is a blank.

<b>                               ANDREW
</b>                ...Hi...

<b>                                                  SMASH CUT TO:
</b>

<b>93A   INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT                                  93A
</b>
      A table in the corner. Fletcher and Andrew seated. They seem to
      have been sitting here in silence for some time. Two drinks
      stand between them. Untouched. The other band members on-stage
      play JAZZ CLUB BLUES, a new PIANIST on the keys and a
      SAXOPHONIST added as well. Finally--
                       Pink (9/10/2013)                     85


<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          So what are you up to these days, Andrew?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          ...Oh, just...you know...various...things...

Fletcher nods. Ok. Andrew eyes him. Then, nervous--

<b>                       ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          ...I--I'm sorry about what happened.
                 (then, should I clarify?--)
          At Dunellen.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          You shouldn't be. A player's got to be
          willing to fight.

Andrew looks at him.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          You played with a broken bone. After
          crashing a car. That's insane.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I was in a different place.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Good thing you're not in that place
          anymore.

A beat. Then -- Fletcher seems distracted. By people CLAPPING
ALONG to the band...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Have you ever noticed it's never the
          people with rhythm who clap along?

He starts CLAPPING loudly, in the proper tempo. Leans over to
the table next to his, where a COUPLE is clapping off-beat, and
starts CLAPPING in their faces. Then sits back down.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't know if you know... I don't teach
          anymore.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          I... I heard about that... You quit?

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          ...No, not exactly.

He looks at Andrew. A moment of tension. Does he know...?
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                  86


<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          A couple parents got a kid from Sean
          Casey's year... I don't know who, I think
          maybe a bassist... They got him to say a
          few things about me... That much I know...
                 (Andrew tries to hide his relief)
          Though why anyone would have anything but
          honey and sugar to say about me is a
          mystery.

Andrew laughs. Seems the mood has lightened.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          That's a good laugh, huh?

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Oh, no... I...I just--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          No, it's ok -- I know I've made some
          enemies. Maybe I seem to think my style
          is normal, but believe me, I don't.

A moment. Fletcher finally takes a sip of his drink.

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm conducting some, though. They're
          bringing back the JVC Fest this year, got
          me opening with a pro band in two weeks.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>                 (genuinely impressed)
          That's amazing.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>                 (shrugs)
          It's ok...

Then, looking off for a moment--

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          The truth is I don't think people
          understand what it is I did at Shaffer. I
          wasn't there to conduct. Any idiot can
          move his hands and keep people in tempo.
          No, it's about pushing people beyond
          what's expected of them. And I believe
          that is a necessity. Because without it
          you're depriving the world of its next
          Armstrong. Its next Parker.
                 (pause)
          Why did Charlie Parker become Charlie
          Parker, Andrew?
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                      87


Beat. Andrew is surprised. He's told this story himself.

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Because Jo Jones threw a cymbal at him.

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Exactly. Young kid, pretty good on the
          sax, goes up to play his solo in a
          cutting session, fucks up -- and Jones
          comes this close to slicing his head off
          for it. He's laughed off-stage. Cries
          himself to sleep that night. But the next
          morning, what does he do? He practices.
          And practices and practices. With one
          goal in mind: that he never ever be
          laughed off-stage again. A year later he
          goes back to the Reno, and he plays the
          best motherfucking solo the world had
          ever heard.

Andrew smiles. Nods. Finally -- unlike his uncles, his cousins,
even his father -- someone who gets it.

<b>                        FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Now imagine if Jones had just patted
          young Charlie on the head and said "Good
          job." Charlie would've said to himself,
          "Well, shit, I did do a good job," and
          that'd be that. No Bird. Tragedy, right?
          Except that's just what people today
          want. The Shaffer Conservatories of the
          world, they want sugar. You don't even
          say "cutting session" anymore, do you?
          No, you say "jam session". What the fuck
          kind of word is that? Jam session? It's a
          cutting session, Andrew, this isn't
          fucking Smucker's. It's about weeding out
          the best from the worst so that the worst
          become better than the best.
                 (beat)
          I mean look around you. $25 drinks, mood
          lighting, a little shrimp cocktail to go
          with your Coltrane. And people wonder why
          jazz is dying.
                 (then,)
          Take it from me, and every Starbucks jazz
          album only proves my point. There are no
          two words more harmful in the entire
          English language than "good job".

Beat. He leans back. Lets his words linger. Andrew thinks...
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                      88


<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          But do you think there's a line? You know
          -- where you discourage the next Charlie
          Parker from becoming Charlie Parker?

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          No. Because the next Charlie Parker would
          never be discouraged.

Andrew takes this in. A moment...

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          ...And you? Are you back to playing now?

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Not really. Here and there... The playing
          never interested me. I never wanted to be
          Charlie Parker. I wanted to be the man
          who made Charlie Parker. The man who
          discovered some scrawny kid, pushed him,
          prodded him, shaped him into something
          great -- and then said to the world,
          "Check this out. The best motherfucking
          solo you've ever heard."

<b>                       ANDREW
</b>          Who's your Charlie Parker, then?
                 (hesitant)
          Sean Casey...?

The name hits Fletcher. Fletcher looks at Andrew -- who
immediately regrets bringing that name up. Why? Because, even
after everything, the sight of Fletcher hurting affects him...

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          Sean... Sean was a sweet kid... And with
          all those idiots saying "This isn't for
          you", Sean did something great. Very few
          people ever get that chance...

He pauses. Looks off. Looks at the musicians on-stage...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          But no... Not Sean Casey.
                 (then, as he thinks about this,)
          The truth is I don't know if I ever had a
          Charlie Parker...
                 (and then,)
          But I tried. And that's more than most
          people can say, Andrew. I tried. And even
          if I never find one, I will never

     He's silent. A look of disappointment.

     Then, he points to the PIANIST on-stage...

<b>                              ANDREW

     Andrew and Fletcher exit. They stand for a second. Look at
     one another. An awkward silence.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Nice seeing you...

     Fletcher nods. Beat. Andrew turns, about to head off, when--

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Look. I don't know how you'll take this.
               That band I'm leading for JVC -- our
               drummer isn't cutting it.
                      (Andrew looks at him blankly...)
               Do you understand...?

<b>                              ANDREW

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               I'm using the Studio Band playlist.
               "Whiplash", "Caravan". I need a
               replacement who already knows those
               charts inside out.

     Andrew looks at him. You can't be serious...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>                      (trying to gather his thoughts)

<b>                            FLETCHER

<b>                             FLETCHER
</b>                He switched to pre-med.
                       (and with a hint of a smile)
                I think he got discouraged.

      Andrew is speechless now. Is this really happening?

<b>                             FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                We're rehearsing next Tuesday. Why don't
                you take the weekend to think about it?

      Andrew takes it all in. WE PUSH in on him, processing... And,
      slowly but surely, his shock and uncertainty harden before our
      eyes -- into resolution... This is something to seize on.

<b>                             ANDREW

      closet doors. In a stack, gathering dust, are his OLD DRUMS...
      Andrew looks at them -- heart swelling, nerves racing...

      An empty theater. It's one of Carnegie Hall's theaters --
      bigger and far sleeker than any of the theaters Studio Band
      played. Ceiling decked with lights, capacity 1200. On the
      stage, rehearsing, is a JAZZ ORCHESTRA.

      Similar set-up to Studio Band, the PLAYERS all young pros --
      except, of course, Andrew, the youngest of all.
                          Pink (9/10/2013)                      91


     The chart is WHIPLASH JVC REHEARSAL, and the band sounds tight.

     The players reach the end -- and Fletcher looks at his watch.
     Composed, even mild.

               Good job.

     Andrew takes this in. The latest in a long line of
     surprises...

     The PLAYERS pack up. Andrew, trying to work past his
     shyness--

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Hope that was ok.

He pulls out his phone. Hesitates. Nervous -- but excited now.
He dials. We hear ringing, he feels his heart thumping, he nods
to himself, starts walking forward, breathes in, and then,
after a few seconds --

          how I... I'm just so sorry... How I
          acted... You know...
                 (a beat; she doesn't respond;
                  he sits down, trying to get
                  the words out--)
          And I -- I didn't know if you knew -- I'm
          playing JVC this weekend... Maybe you'd
          like to come? We could grab pizza afterward

Beat. WE CUT to a CLOSE-UP of Andrew as he takes this in. You
can tell -- the word hits him hard.

       Nicole hangs up. You can see it in Andrew's eyes -- real
       disappointment. Real hurt. And surprise at how hurt he feels.

       He eyes his drums again. Sits down at them --

       -- and STARTS PRACTICING LIKE MAD. Pouring his anger, his hurt,
       into his playing.

       The SOUNDS of FURIOUS DRUMMING build, continuing through the
       following--

       all alone...

       He straightens his tie. De-lints the suit. He's tidy, �ber-

       the keys. Grabs his music folder and heads to the door...

       tapping on his knees. The clock's ticking...

       He checks his phone, picks up speed, almost breaks into a jog...

       The DRUMMING BUILDS, he goes FASTER and FASTER, until,
       finally --

       -- as the DRUMMING CUTS OUT --

       -- he comes to a sudden stop.

       He's standing right in front of CARNEGIE HALL. A giant banner
       hangs above the main steps: "JVC IN NYC: JAZZ!" And, keeping
       out of sight --

       -- Fletcher. Strolling up the side-steps around the corner,
       hidden from the crowd. Andrew sees him. Follows.

       TRUMPETERS, TROMBONISTS and SAXOPHONISTS join in. Andrew
       stands back. Checks his phone. 7:28. It's almost time. He

       Andrew and the Studio Band listen to Fletcher's speech.

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                 Alright, gang, listen up! 15 seconds to
                 get into places. For those of you who are
                 new to this, it's very simple: do well
                 tonight, and the world will open up for
                 you. The folks out there, they make a

                 switching careers -- because the other
                 thing about those cats is they never
                 forget.

       forward --

      The stage is decked in blue lights. The instruments gleam.
      Beyond it, a yawning expanse of black. The audience... And a
      hush, an undercurrent of murmurs and whispers gathering
      steam, as each PLAYER takes to the stage, one by one...

      Then -- APPLAUSE. 1200 people's worth of applause. Fletcher
      appears, taking his spot, smiling. The applause swells up.

      And then -- Fletcher turns around to face Andrew. He stares
      at him for what seems like a full minute. Comes up to him,
      making as though helping him position a microphone over the
      drum kit, and, leaning in, quietly, discreetly, menacingly--

<b>                               FLETCHER
</b>                It was you.

      The lights shift. Blue to bright, harsh, near-blinding yellow.
      It's showtime. Andrew is completely still.

<b>                             ANDREW

                Why do you think I invited you here? I've
                known it was you all along.

      Beat. He lets it sink in. Retreats to his spot, smiling at
      Andrew. Then, off Andrew's paralyzed stare, he turns to the
      audience. They APPLAUD. A few seconds later...silence. Then--

<b>                             FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We're
                going to start things off with an old
                favorite of mine.

      Andrew, his heart in his throat, looks at his sheet music.
      "WHIPLASH". Holds his sticks tight, but his hands are now
      slippery with sweat... Fletcher waits. More silence...

<b>                             FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                It's called "Upswingin'".

      ON ANDREW. What?

      Andrew turns to his left and catches a glimpse of the
      SAXOPHONISTS' sheet music. Written on the top: "UPSWINGIN'". He
      turns right, sees the BASSIST's music. Ditto. He looks ahead.
      And there's Fletcher -- staring right back at him. And smiling.
                      Pink (9/10/2013)                    97


Andrew turns around. Has to stop this. Can't ruin it for the
other PLAYERS -- but Fletcher has already raised his hand for
the cue. Andrew rises from his seat -- when the BASSIST
glares at him: What are you doing? And just then -- within
that same split-second --

-- Fletcher's index finger bends down.

The cue.

The BAND EXPLODES into UPSWINGIN'. Horns blasting, saxes
wailing -- fast, furious, half-Latin and half-swing. Andrew
doesn't even play at first -- doesn't want to destroy this. But
glares quickly follow, and he has no choice...

He plays. Trains his ears to try to stay on target... But the
time signature is impossible to get a firm grip on... He
misses a fill... Then the time signature changes... He can't
keep up... Then the band gives way to rubato piano... He stops
late... Then the band surges back in... He comes in late...
He's driving completely blind.

<b>                        BASSIST
</b>                  (clenched teeth to Andrew)
           The fuck?! Come on...

Andrew, desperate, tries to fix things -- but he can't.
Sliding further and further behind. PLAYERS eying him. You
can almost hear MURMURS in the audience, rising in volume...
And, through it all, Fletcher seems serene.

Andrew misses yet another break, and--

<b>                        BASSIST (CONT'D)
</b>           Are you fucking kidding me?

This hits Andrew like a knife. Tears well up in his eyes. This
performance is already so far beyond saving...

Another missed hit. More MURMURS in the audience, louder and
louder now, as the number veers, swerves, and sloppily
staggers to its close... A swell of horns, a misplaced crash
of cymbals, what seems like a fermata... Andrew stops -- just
as the band RESUMES. And just as Andrew resumes -- the band
<b>STOPS.
</b>
Andrew's playing alone. He quickly moves to silence his
drums. The chart is done.

And now -- the deafening silence.

No applause. Just the sound softly rippling and settling from
Andrew's last cymbal hit...
                            Pink (9/10/2013)                      98


      Andrew sits at his set, in tears. Fletcher stays still. Looks
      at Andrew. On Fletcher's face, the look of a victor... As he
      turns back to the audience we hear...

      ...a smattering of polite, muted applause trickling
      throughout the theater. Quiet, half-hearted, pitiful.

      No one here has ever seen a disaster quite like that before.

<b>      IN THE AUDIENCE
</b>
      We see Jim, standing in the very back, by the doors...
      Mortified, heading for the hall...

<b>      ON STAGE
</b>
      Fletcher sashays back to the drum set. To Andrew, with a grin--

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                 I guess you don't have it.

      Andrew is still in his seat. Tears stinging his cheeks...

<b>                              BASSIST
</b>                 Didn't you get the fucking chart?

      Andrew looks at the Bassist. Realizes what Fletcher did... Sees
      the other MUSICIANS glaring at him, infuriated...

<b>      IN THE AUDIENCE
</b>
      Andrew feels the AUDIENCE staring at him -- can almost make out
      their faces as the stage lights begin to DIM...

      Seated in one of the front rows -- is NICOLE. We see that next
      to her, holding her hand, is a YOUNG MAN...

<b>      ON STAGE
</b>
      Feeling CRUSHED, HUMILIATED, NAUSEATED, Andrew staggers up...

      ...and RETREATS to the back of the stage. Out of the audience's
      view -- about to leave this all behind once and for all...


<b>107   INT. ZANKEL HALL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                    107
</b>
      Jim running... Down the hall... Toward the entrance to
      backstage...
                           Pink (9/10/2013)                       99


<b>108   INT. ZANKEL HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS                   108
</b>
      Back to Andrew... Retreating BACKSTAGE...

      ...when he sees -- around the corner of the backstage entrance --

      -- his father.

<b>      IN THE WINGS
</b>
      Jim has just arrived at the entryway. Looks at Andrew. Hurries
      toward him. Is going to put an end to this. Andrew looks at
      his dad for a moment, approaching. Jim reaches him --

      -- and HUGS him.

<b>                             JIM
</b>                I love you. I'm so sorry this is
                happening to you.

      Andrew looks at his dad. Something seems to click inside him at
      that instant.

      He pulls back. The desperation in his eyes giving way to
      something else. Jim watches Andrew as Andrew steps backward,
      before...

      ...a pair of STAGE HANDS arrive.

<b>                             STAGE HAND
</b>                Sir, you can't be here--

<b>                             JIM
</b>                Yes I can, I'm taking him with me--

<b>                             STAGE HAND
</b>                       (to Andrew)
                You know each other?

      Andrew is silent for a moment. Still. As though it has just
      dawned on him.

      He takes in the sight -- his dad, dwarfed by the Stage Hands,
      reaching out to him. Jim has never looked quite so small to his
      son, quite so pathetic, as at this moment.

      A beat. More silence. And then --

<b>                             ANDREW
</b>                No.

      Jim goes wide-eyed. Utterly shocked. Andrew steps further
      back, as the STAGE HANDS move to pull Jim away--
                       Pink (9/10/2013)                 100


<b>                        STAGE HAND
</b>           Alright, sir, that's enough--

<b>                        JIM
</b>           My -- my son -- I need to get my son--

<b>                        STAGE HAND
</b>           Let's calm down--

<b>                        JIM
</b>                  (frantic now--)
           Andrew!!

Andrew calmly turns his back to his father and coldly heads to
the stage.

<b>                        JIM (CONT'D)
</b>           Andrew!!!

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Andrew grabs new sticks, makes as though he was just switching
pairs and never leaving, and, ignoring his father's calls from
behind -- trains his eyes back on Fletcher.

Fletcher looks at Andrew. Seems pleased: This will be fun...

But Andrew doesn't look scared anymore. Instead, his eyes are
glassy, hollowed out -- and hungry... There's a rage in them
that we haven't seen before... This will not be the end...

<b>                        FLETCHER
</b>                  (to the audience)
           Thank you... For our final number we're
           bringing it back to Ellington. This is
           "Caravan".

But then, before Fletcher can even turn back around -- let alone
cue the band -- Andrew launches into a double-time Latin.

Alone, his stick beating away at the ride cymbal, setting the
tempo for the rest of the band. Everyone looks at him. What
the fuck...? He has started on his own, before any cue,
beating the drums as though vengefully.

Fletcher glares at him. Who the fuck do you think you are? But
Andrew just keeps playing. Knows exactly what he's doing and is
not about to be stopped. Building in his eyes -- that same
coiled rage... To the BASSIST--

<b>                        ANDREW
</b>           Follow me on four.
                       Pink (9/10/2013)                  101


The BASSIST has no choice. Andrew nods in time as a count-off,
and the BASSIST joins in. Now we've got the bass and drums
playing, laying out the beat. Andrew looks back at Fletcher.
Drills into him with his eyes -- the kind of look Fletcher has so
often given him. And, subtly, so that only Fletcher can see it,
Andrew mouths out two words:

<b>                        ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          Fuck. You.

It hits Fletcher. Realizing he too has no choice, Fletcher eyes
the rest of the band. Raises his hands, re-assuming control --
or trying to make as though he has control -- and cues them in.
The BAND begins CARAVAN PLUS DRUM SOLO CARNEGIE HALL, plays the
opening patterns, Andrew matching them beat for beat.

Fletcher then edges toward Andrew. His back turned to the
audience, only Andrew can see his face, he leans in and--

<b>                       FLETCHER
</b>          I will gouge out your eyes you motherfucker.

--but Andrew promptly DROWNS HIM OUT with a crash cymbal hit.
Another "fuck you". Fletcher's words only seem to strengthen him.

The band roars into overdrive, the brass blasting away, Andrew
giving everything he's got. Fletcher steps back. Andrew just
keeps looking straight ahead at him. Unafraid now. A machine.

SOLOS begin... TROMBONE is up first... WE MOVE IN CLOSE to
Andrew... He looks at his right arm... It's still going... He
himself seems surprised. He takes a chance -- plays a tricky
fill. Nails it. Goes again -- the off-beat hi-hat accent that
tripped him up in his first Studio Band rehearsal. Nails it.

The audience is silent... No murmurs this time... Back to
Andrew... WE DRIFT DOWN TO HIS FEET... His right foot feathering
the bass drum so fast all we can see is a blur...

WE DRIFT BACK UP... His left hand... Notes popping on the
snare, the toms... Both his arms battered but utterly
determined, as though with minds of their own... He breathes,
breathes, beating against his fears, his doubts...

He's in control, pouring himself into his drums -- and it's a
sight to behold. Like a master dancer, movements so fast yet
precise, brash yet elegant... Violent, frenetic playing, but
there's something gorgeous about it...

WE DRIFT TO FLETCHER... Still glaring at Andrew -- but his
face now says one thing and one thing only: This is playing
he has never seen before.
                      Pink (9/10/2013)                    102


The brass starts giving way to drum breaks... And Andrew
makes of each break a stunner... His double-stroke rolls rip-
roaring across the toms, his feet and legs switching rhythms,
meters, tempos, then careening back into place... All limbs
moving in a sustained frenzy, sweat splashing, mouth open,
eyes blazing, the whole set vibrating, then shaking, looks
like it's about to explode...

Fletcher turns an inch toward the AUDIENCE... Sees them
transfixed...

<b>AT THE LOBBY DOORS
</b>
...Jim watches through the opened lobby doors...

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
The number is at a peak... And Fletcher, like so many, is now
just watching Andrew... The band nears the coda... The
melody, the rat-a-tat-tat patterns, the squealing horns and
growling saxes... The drums pushing it all forward...

Fletcher almost smiles. Was this his plan all along...?

He moves his arms, conducting again... The band reaches the
final bar... The final note... He raises his hands... Sustains
the note... Swings his arm down... A BLAST of horns. And the
band is finished.

Except, that is, for the drums. Andrew's still playing,
launching into an extended solo...

Fletcher looks at him. Confused now. Goes up to the drums--

<b>                        FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>           Andrew -- Andrew--

<b>                        ANDREW
</b>                  (over his playing)
           I'll cue the band... Wait for my cue...

There's nothing more Fletcher can do. Andrew's playing grows
louder, more involved, all four limbs joining in, the sound
growing bigger and bigger... He has effectively taken over
the stage -- and all the other PLAYERS can do is watch... He
is the bandleader.

Andrew looks ahead... Past Fletcher... To the darkness... To
the audience... He leans forward, closes his eyes, dives in...

Sticks whirling, arms and legs belting and hammering, his
head bobbing up and down, his back arched... Keeps the
rudiments going on his left hand... Adds one ingredient, then
another... Then a third, then a fourth...
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                      103


Keeps adding and building and piling on, beyond anything he's
ever attempted... Going absolutely batshit-insane on the kit,
sweat flying, hands blurring, drums trembling...

<b>AT THE LOBBY DOORS
</b>
Jim watches Andrew -- crazed, exhausted, looks like he's
pushing himself past what is safe -- and knows there is
no longer anything he can do about it.

He has lost.

And then -- one of the USHERS steps forward from the edge
of the stage. He looks at Jim -- and closes the doors,
blocking Jim's view.

We linger on Jim for a moment -- behind the closed door, in
silence.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Back to Andrew -- at the height of intensity... Keeps his
eyes closed... Feeling his way through this... Shooting back
into the double-time... But trying to go even faster than
before... Not 330... Not even 400... Trying, trying, trying
to reach that mythical place, the place where only the greats
live... 410... 420... Even 430...

Fletcher stands still... His eyes widening... He's no longer
calculating... Not even thinking... He's just awed.

Murmurs throughout the AUDIENCE... Audible, even over the
roar of the drum set... They can't believe it...

435 now... 440... 443...

Which means those sticks are moving faster than a tennis ball
shot across a court... Faster than Andrew has ever moved...

Faster...faster...and, finally...

<b>...450.
</b>
Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... He's in disbelief. The stage is his.
He owns it. He breaks back into snare-based patterns, rolling
around the toms, the cymbals...

Fletcher is floored. Turns, sees something extraordinary out
there, just visible in the darkness of the theater...

<b>IN THE AUDIENCE
</b>
AUDIENCE MEMBERS turning to each other... A line-up of suit-
and-tie spectators whipping out phones or pads...
                         Pink (9/10/2013)                  104


MANAGERS, JOURNALISTS, A&amp;R EXECS, BANDLEADERS... A few
hurrying out, as though in a mad rush, making frantic calls...
More people peering INTO THE THEATER through glass doors...

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
We TURN BACK to Andrew -- his ears start RINGING... The NOISE
grows with each hit, drowning out all the other noises...
Andrew clenches his jaw, closes his eyes again, keeps
playing, tries to ignore it... Plays harder, louder, pounding
away...

Andrew's kick drum starts to slide from the power of his
playing... His sheet music falls off its stand... His
crash cymbal almost falls over -- but a HAND reaches in
to steady it.

It's Fletcher. Leaning over the drum set now -- and, for
almost the first time on-stage, not cursing or snarling at
Andrew, but instead--

<b>                        FLETCHER
</b>           Take it back to the snare...

Andrew considers this. It's a good idea. He moves back to the
snare...

<b>                        FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>           Slow...
                  (Andrew does as suggested)
           Single-stroke...

Andrew nods again... Slowly simmers the beat down... Lets his
hi-hat hang open for a moment... Everything goes quiet...

Silence for a second... You can feel the hush, the
anticipation, that indescribable electricity in the air...

Fletcher looks at Andrew, looks at his sticks, face brimming
with hope now... Andrew begins a series of slow, clean snare
hits... Right stroke, left stroke, right, left...

<b>                          FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>           Up... Up...

Andrew nods... Ever so gradually builds up the pace... Right,
left, right, left... Builds up the pace some more... Right,
left, right, left... Keeps going... Speeds up more, a hair at
a time... Right, left... Speeds up more.. Right, left...

Fletcher stands there, nodding, focused, like a coach at the
critical moment. Waves his hand, pushing Andrew on...
                     Pink (9/10/2013)                     105


Andrew builds the tempo more, right, left, right, left, the
strokes blurring into each other, the whole thing sounding
like the fire of a machine gun, like what we heard in the
beginning... Right-left-right-left-right-left...

And, before we know it, we can no longer make out the
individual strokes. They're so fast that all we can hear is a
single SOUND, sustained and growing in volume...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on... Come on...

Andrew, goaded on, builds the volume. His single-stroke roll
swelling, taking over the entire theater...

<b>                       FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on...!! Come on!!!

Andrew builds it further... Going beyond what even he'd
planned for himself -- his arms like machines, the single-
stroke roll building steam and power and pinning the audience
in their seats... Fletcher raising his hands, beckoning
Andrew forward... He and the drummer working together, player
and conductor, competitor and coach...

Andrew moves to the toms, then back to the snare, then back.
The bass drum and hi-hat next, every part of the set joining in,
every limb, every component, everything building up, up, up...

It's unlike anything we've ever seen... Andrew tearing a hole
through the stage, his heartbeat racing, the sweat pouring from
him like a waterfall, blood gushing from his hands and staining
the cymbals and drum-heads... Everything a BLUR...

Then -- a BLAST OF SEPARATED SNARE HITS -- and then -- Andrew
CHOKES the crash cymbal. A second of pure silence.

Fletcher looks at Andrew. Andrew looks at Fletcher. And then --
Fletcher turns to the band, raises his hand...

...and CUES THE FINAL NOTE.

The whole band roars it out, horns hitting their highest C's,
and Andrew rolling around his drum set like a madman, cymbals
and snare and toms and the entire apparatus about to burst, as
WE DIVE IN CLOSE TO HIM, his instrument, his sticks, his face,
all sweat and eyes about to pop, the next Buddy Rich, the next
Charlie Parker -- Fletcher's only Charlie Parker -- decking
the stage with a climactic crash of cymbals right as, on that
very last hit of hits, we--

<b>                                           SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>                         THE END
