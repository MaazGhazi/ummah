01:20:27,081 --> 01:20:28,249
They said
you might be up here.

1243
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:29,417
Shh.

1244
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:32,628
Give me your hand.

1245
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:41,471
Now close your eyes.

1246
01:20:42,805 --> 01:20:44,140
Go on.

1247
01:20:47,477 --> 01:20:48,978
Now, step up.

1248
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:54,108
Now, hold onto the railing.

1249
01:20:54,192 --> 01:20:56,194
Keep your eyes closed.
Don't peek.

1250
01:20:56,444 --> 01:20:57,445
I'm not.

1251
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,823
Now, step up onto the rail.

1252
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:06,829
Hold on. Hold on.

1253
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,539
Keep your eyes closed.
